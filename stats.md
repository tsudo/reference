  - In 2017, spear-phishing emails were the most widely used infection vector, employed by 71 percent of those groups that staged cyber attacks
  - "One of the biggest changes has been a shift away from using malicious attachments to a preference for utilizing malicious URLs, instead. In 2017, for example, Proofpoint reported 3 out of 4 malspam emails delivered malware via attachments. Fast-forward to Q1 2018 and the firm's data showed that emails with malicious links outnumbered emails with malicious attachments 4 to 1"
