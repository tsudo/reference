Intended Audience

This document is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists,
auditors, help desk, platform deployment, and/or DevOps personnel who plan to develop,
deploy, assess, or secure solutions in Amazon Web Services.

Consensus Guidance

This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of subject
matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of
backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security
research, operations, government, and legal.

Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs
during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene
to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until
consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins
after the benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the
Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the
benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit
https://workbench.cisecurity.org/.

Recommendations

1 Identity and Access Management

This section contains recommendations for configuring identity and access management
related options.

9 | P a g e

1.1 Avoid the use of the "root" account (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

The "root" account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. It is highly
recommended that the use of this account be avoided.

Rationale:

The "root" account is the most privileged AWS account. Minimizing the use of this account
and adopting the principle of least privilege for access management will reduce the risk of
accidental changes and unintended disclosure of highly privileged credentials.

Audit:

Implement the Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of "root"
account recommendation in the Monitoring section of this benchmark to receive
notifications of root account usage. Additionally, executing the following commands will
provide ad-hoc means for determining the last time the root account was used:

aws iam generate-credential-report

aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d |
cut -d, -f1,5,11,16 | grep -B1 '<root_account>'

Note: there are a few conditions under which the use of the root account is required, such
as requesting a penetration test or creating a CloudFront private key.

Remediation:

Follow the remediation instructions of the Ensure IAM policies are attached only to
groups or roles recommendation

2.  CIS CSC v6.0 #5.1

10 | P a g e

CIS Controls:

4.3 Ensure the Use of Dedicated Administrative Accounts
Ensure that all users with administrative account access use a dedicated or secondary
account for elevated activities. This account should only be used for administrative
activities and not internet browsing, email, or similar activities.

11 | P a g e

1.2 Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM
users that have a console password (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name
and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be
prompted for their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from
their AWS MFA device. It is recommended that MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a
console password.

Rationale:

Enabling MFA provides increased security for console access as it requires the
authenticating principal to possess a device that emits a time-sensitive key and have
knowledge of a credential.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if a MFA device is enabled for all IAM users having a
console password:
Via Management Console

1.  Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2.  In the left pane, select Users
3.  If the MFA Device or Password columns are not visible in the table, click the gear

icon at the upper right corner of the table and ensure a checkmark is next to both,
then click Close .

4.  Ensure each user having a checkmark in the Password column also has a value in the

MFA Device column.

Via the CLI

1.  Run the following command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) to generate a list of all IAM users

along with their password and MFA status:

  aws iam generate-credential-report

12 | P a g e

  aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d |
cut -d, -f1,4,8

2.  The output of this command will produce a table similar to the following:

  user,password_enabled,mfa_active
  elise,false,false
  brandon,true,true
  rakesh,false,false
  helene,false,false
  paras,true,true
  anitha,false,false

3.  For any column having password_enabled set to true , ensure mfa_active is also set

to true.

Remediation:

Perform the following to enable MFA:

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2.  In the navigation pane, choose Users.
3.  In the User Name list, choose the name of the intended MFA user.
4.  Choose the Security Credentials tab, and then choose Manage MFA Device.
5.  In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose A virtual MFA device, and then choose

Next Step.

IAM generates and displays configuration information for the virtual MFA device, including
a QR code graphic. The graphic is a representation of the 'secret configuration key' that is
available for manual entry on devices that do not support QR codes.
6. Open your virtual MFA application. (For a list of apps that you can use for hosting virtual
MFA devices, see Virtual MFA Applications.) If the virtual MFA application supports
multiple accounts (multiple virtual MFA devices), choose the option to create a new
account (a new virtual MFA device).
7. Determine whether the MFA app supports QR codes, and then do one of the following:

  Use the app to scan the QR code. For example, you might choose the camera icon or
choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the
code.
In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual
configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application.



13 | P a g e

When you are finished, the virtual MFA device starts generating one-time passwords.
8. In the Manage MFA Device wizard, in the Authentication Code 1 box, type the one-time
password that currently appears in the virtual MFA device. Wait up to 30 seconds for the
device to generate a new one-time password. Then type the second one-time password into
the Authentication Code 2 box. Choose Active Virtual MFA.
Forced IAM User Self-Service Remediation
Amazon has published a pattern that forces users to self-service setup MFA before they
have access to their complete permissions set. Until they complete this step, they cannot
access their full permissions. This pattern can be used on new AWS accounts. It can also be
used on existing accounts - it is recommended users are given instructions and a grace
period to accomplish MFA enrollment before active enforcement on existing AWS accounts.

1.3 Ensure credentials unused for 90 days or greater are disabled
(Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

AWS IAM users can access AWS resources using different types of credentials, such as
passwords or access keys. It is recommended that all credentials that have been unused in
90 or greater days be removed or deactivated.

Rationale:

Disabling or removing unnecessary credentials will reduce the window of opportunity for
credentials associated with a compromised or abandoned account to be used.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if unused credentials exist:
Download Credential Report:
Using Management Console:

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console
2.  Click Services
3.  Click IAM
4.  Click on Credential Report
5.  This will download an .xls file which contains credential usage for all users within

an AWS Account - open this file

Via CLI

1.  Run the following commands:

  aws iam generate-credential-report

  aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d |
cut -d, -f1,4,5,6,9,10,11,14,15,16

Ensure unused credentials does not exist:

15 | P a g e

2.  For each user having password_enabled set to TRUE , ensure

password_last_used_date is less than 90 days ago.

  When password_enabled is set to TRUE and password_last_used is set to

No_Information , ensure password_last_changed is less than 90 days ago.

3.  For each user having an access_key_1_active or access_key_2_active to TRUE ,

ensure the corresponding access_key_n_last_used_date is less than 90 days ago.

  When a user having an access_key_x_active (where x is 1 or 2) to TRUE and

corresponding access_key_x_last_used_date is set to N/A',
ensureaccess_key_x_last_rotated` is less than 90 days ago.

Remediation:

Perform the following to remove or deactivate credentials:

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console:
2.  Click Services
3.  Click IAM
4.  Click on Users
5.  Click on Security Credentials
6.  As an Administrator

  Click on Make Inactive for credentials that have not been used in 90 Days

7.  As an IAM User

  Click on Make Inactive or Delete for credentials which have not been used in 90

Days

CIS Controls:

16.9 Disable Dormant Accounts
Automatically disable dormant accounts after a set period of inactivity.

16 | P a g e

1.4 Ensure access keys are rotated every 90 days or less (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign
programmatic requests that you make to AWS. AWS users need their own access keys to
make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), Tools
for Windows PowerShell, the AWS SDKs, or direct HTTP calls using the APIs for individual
AWS services. It is recommended that all access keys be regularly rotated.

Rationale:

Rotating access keys will reduce the window of opportunity for an access key that is
associated with a compromised or terminated account to be used.

Access keys should be rotated to ensure that data cannot be accessed with an old key which
might have been lost, cracked, or stolen.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if access keys are rotated as prescribed:

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console
2.  Click Services
3.  Click IAM
4.  Click on Credential Report
5.  This will download an .xls file which contains Access Key usage for all IAM users

within an AWS Account - open this file

6.  Focus on the following columns (where x = 1 or 2)

  access_key_X_active
  access_key_X_last_rotated

7.  Ensure all active keys have been rotated within 90 days

Via CLI
aws iam generate-credential-report
aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d

Remediation:

17 | P a g e

Perform the following to rotate access keys:

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console:
2.  Click Services
3.  Click IAM
4.  Click on Users
5.  Click on Security Credentials
6.  As an Administrator

  Click on Make Inactive for keys that have not been rotated in 90 Days

7.  As an IAM User

  Click on Make Inactive or Delete for keys which have not been rotated or used in 90

Days

8.  Click on `` Create Access Key
9.  Update programmatic call with new Access Key credentials

(Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

Password policies are, in part, used to enforce password complexity requirements. IAM
password policies can be used to ensure password are comprised of different character
sets. It is recommended that the password policy require at least one uppercase letter.

1.11 Ensure IAM password policy expires passwords within 90 days or
less (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

IAM password policies can require passwords to be rotated or expired after a given
number of days. It is recommended that the password policy expire passwords after 90
days or less.

Rationale:

Reducing the password lifetime increases account resiliency against brute force login
attempts. Additionally, requiring regular password changes help in the following scenarios:

  Passwords can be stolen or compromised sometimes without your knowledge. This
can happen via a system compromise, software vulnerability, or internal threat.
  Certain corporate and government web filters or proxy servers have the ability to

intercept and record traffic even if it's encrypted.

  Many people use the same password for many systems such as work, email, and

personal.

  Compromised end user workstations might have a keystroke logger.

1.12 Ensure no root account access key exists (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. AWS Access Keys provide
programmatic access to a given AWS account. It is recommended that all access keys
associated with the root account be removed.

Rationale:

Removing access keys associated with the root account limits vectors by which the account
can be compromised. Additionally, removing the root access keys encourages the creation
and use of role based accounts that are least privileged.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if the root account has access keys:
Via the AWS Console

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console
2.  Click Services
3.  Click IAM
4.  Click on Credential Report
5.  This will download an .xls file which contains credential usage for all IAM users

within an AWS Account - open this file

6.  For the <root_account> user, ensure the access_key_1_active and

access_key_2_active fields are set to FALSE .

1.  Run the following commands:

  aws iam generate-credential-report
  aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d |

1.13 Ensure MFA is enabled for the "root" account (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of
protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to
an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an
authentication code from their AWS MFA device.

Note: When virtual MFA is used for root accounts, it is recommended that the device used
is NOT a personal device, but rather a dedicated mobile device (tablet or phone) that is
managed to be kept charged and secured independent of any individual personal devices.
("non-personal virtual MFA") This lessens the risks of losing access to the MFA due to
device loss, device trade-in or if the individual owning the device is no longer employed at
the company.

Rationale:

Enabling MFA provides increased security for console access as it requires the
authenticating principal to possess a device that emits a time-sensitive key and have
knowledge of a credential.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if the root account has MFA setup:

1.  Run the following command:

  aws iam get-account-summary | grep "AccountMFAEnabled"

2.  Ensure the AccountMFAEnabled property is set to 1

Remediation:

Perform the following to establish MFA for the root account:

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

35 | P a g e

Note: to manage MFA devices for the root AWS account, you must use your root account
credentials to sign in to AWS. You cannot manage MFA devices for the root account using
other credentials.
2. Choose Dashboard , and under Security Status , expand Activate MFA on your root
account.
3. Choose Activate MFA
4. In the wizard, choose A virtual MFA device and then choose Next Step .
5. IAM generates and displays configuration information for the virtual MFA device,
including a QR code graphic. The graphic is a representation of the 'secret configuration
key' that is available for manual entry on devices that do not support QR codes.
6. Open your virtual MFA application. (For a list of apps that you can use for hosting virtual
MFA devices, see Virtual MFA Applications.) If the virtual MFA application supports
multiple accounts (multiple virtual MFA devices), choose the option to create a new
account (a new virtual MFA device).
7. Determine whether the MFA app supports QR codes, and then do one of the following:

  Use the app to scan the QR code. For example, you might choose the camera icon or
choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the
code.
In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual
configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application.



When you are finished, the virtual MFA device starts generating one-time passwords.

1.  In the Manage MFA Device wizard, in the Authentication Code 1 box, type the one-
time password that currently appears in the virtual MFA device. Wait up to 30
seconds for the device to generate a new one-time password. Then type the second
one-time password into the Authentication Code 2 box. Choose Active Virtual MFA.

1.14 Ensure hardware MFA is enabled for the "root" account (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2

Description:

The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of
protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to
an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an
authentication code from their AWS MFA device. For Level 2, it is recommended that the
root account be protected with a hardware MFA.

Rationale:

A hardware MFA has a smaller attack surface than a virtual MFA. For example, a hardware
MFA does not suffer the attack surface introduced by the mobile smartphone on which a
virtual MFA resides.

Note: Using hardware MFA for many, many AWS accounts may create a logistical device
management issue. If this is the case, consider implementing this Level 2 recommendation
selectively to the highest security AWS accounts and the Level 1 recommendation applied
to the remaining accounts.

Link to order AWS compatible hardware MFA device: http://onlinenoram.gemalto.com/

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if the root account has a hardware MFA setup:

1.  Run the following command to determine if the root account has MFA setup:

  aws iam get-account-summary | grep "AccountMFAEnabled"

The AccountMFAEnabled property is set to 1 will ensure that root account has MFA (Virtual
or Hardware) Enabled.
If AccountMFAEnabled property is set to 0 the account is not compliant with this
recommendation.

37 | P a g e

2.  If AccountMFAEnabled property is set to 1, determine root account has Hardware

MFA enabled.
Run the following command to list all virtual MFA devices:

  aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices

If the output contains one MFA with the following Serial Number, it means the MFA is
virtual, not hardware and the account is not compliant with this recommendation:
"SerialNumber": "arn:aws:iam::_<aws_account_number>_:mfa/root-account-mfa-
device"

Remediation:

Perform the following to establish a hardware MFA for the root account:

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

Note: to manage MFA devices for the root AWS account, you must use your root account
credentials to sign in to AWS. You cannot manage MFA devices for the root account using
other credentials.
2. Choose Dashboard , and under Security Status , expand Activate MFA on your root
account.
3. Choose Activate MFA
4. In the wizard, choose A hardware MFA device and then choose Next Step .
5. In the Serial Number box, enter the serial number that is found on the back of the MFA
device.
6. In the Authentication Code 1 box, enter the six-digit number displayed by the MFA
device. You might need to press the button on the front of the device to display the number.
7. Wait 30 seconds while the device refreshes the code, and then enter the next six-digit
number into the Authentication Code 2 box. You might need to press the button on the
front of the device again to display the second number.
8. Choose Next Step . The MFA device is now associated with the AWS account. The next
time you use your AWS account credentials to sign in, you must type a code from the
hardware MFA device.

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

The AWS support portal allows account owners to establish security questions that can be
used to authenticate individuals calling AWS customer service for support. It is
recommended that security questions be established.

Rationale:

When creating a new AWS account, a default super user is automatically created. This
account is referred to as the "root" account. It is recommended that the use of this account
be limited and highly controlled. During events in which the Root password is no longer
accessible or the MFA token associated with root is lost/destroyed it is possible, through
authentication using secret questions and associated answers, to recover root login access.

Audit:

Perform the following in the AWS Management Console:

1.  Login to the AWS account as root
2.  On the top right you will see the <Root_Account_Name>
3.  Click on the <Root_Account_Name>

1.16 Ensure IAM policies are attached only to groups or roles (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

By default, IAM users, groups, and roles have no access to AWS resources. IAM policies are
the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is recommended
that IAM policies be applied directly to groups and roles but not users.

Rationale:

Assigning privileges at the group or role level reduces the complexity of access
management as the number of users grow. Reducing access management complexity may
in-turn reduce opportunity for a principal to inadvertently receive or retain excessive
privileges.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if policies are attached directly to users:

1.  Run the following to get a list of IAM users:

  aws iam list-users --query 'Users[*].UserName' --output text

2.  For each user returned, run the following command to determine if any policies are

attached to them:

  aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name  <iam_user>
  aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <iam_user>

3.  If any policies are returned, the user has a direct policy attachment.

Remediation:

Perform the following to create an IAM group and assign a policy to it:

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2.  In the navigation pane, click Groups and then click Create New Group .
3.  In the Group Name box, type the name of the group and then click Next Step .

1.17 Maintain current contact details (Not Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

Ensure contact email and telephone details for AWS accounts are current and map to more
than one individual in your organization.

An AWS account supports a number of contact details, and AWS will use these to contact
the account owner if activity judged to be in breach of Acceptable Use Policy or indicative
of likely security compromise is observed by the AWS Abuse team. Contact details should
not be for a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual is
unavailable. Email contact details should point to a mail alias which forwards email to
multiple individuals within the organization; where feasible, phone contact details should
point to a PABX hunt group or other call-forwarding system.

Rationale:

If an AWS account is observed to be behaving in a prohibited or suspicious manner, AWS
will attempt to contact the account owner by email and phone using the contact details
listed. If this is unsuccessful and the account behavior needs urgent mitigation, proactive
measures may be taken, including throttling of traffic between the account exhibiting
suspicious behavior and the AWS API endpoints and the Internet. This will result in
impaired service to and from the account in question, so it is in both the customers’ and
AWS’ best interests that prompt contact can be established. This is best achieved by setting
AWS account contact details to point to resources which have multiple individuals as
recipients, such as email aliases and PABX hunt groups.

1.19 Ensure IAM instance roles are used for AWS resource access from
instances (Not Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2

Description:

AWS access from within AWS instances can be done by either encoding AWS keys into AWS
API calls or by assigning the instance to a role which has an appropriate permissions policy
for the required access. "AWS Access" means accessing the APIs of AWS in order to access
AWS resources or manage AWS account resources.

Rationale:

AWS IAM roles reduce the risks associated with sharing and rotating credentials that can
be used outside of AWS itself. If credentials are compromised, they can be used from
outside of the AWS account they give access to. In contrast, in order to leverage role
permissions an attacker would need to gain and maintain access to a specific instance to
use the privileges associated with it.

Additionally, if credentials are encoded into compiled applications or other hard to change
mechanisms, then they are even more unlikely to be properly rotated due to service
disruption risks. As time goes on, credentials that cannot be rotated are more likely to be
known by an increasing number of individuals who no longer work for the organization
owning the credentials.

Audit:

Whether an Instance Is Associated With a Role
For instances that are known to perform AWS actions, ensure that they belong to an
instance role that has the necessary permissions:

1.  Login to AWS Console (with appropriate permissions to View Identity Access

Management Account Settings)

2.  Open the EC2 Dashboard and choose "Instances"
3.  Click the EC2 instance that performs AWS actions, in the lower pane details find

"IAM Role"

4.  If the Role is blank, the instance is not assigned to one.
5.  If the Role is filled in, it does not mean the instance might not *also* have credentials

encoded on it for some activities.

48 | P a g e

Whether an Instance Contains Embedded Credentials
On the instance that is known to perform AWS actions, audit all scripts and environment
variables to ensure that none of them contain AWS credentials.
Whether an Instance Application Contains Embedded Credentials
Applications that run on an instance may also have credentials embedded. This is a bad
practice, but even worse if the source code is stored in a public code repository such as
github. When an application contains credentials can be determined by eliminating all
other sources of credentials and if the application can still access AWS resources - it likely
contains embedded credentials. Another method is to examine all source code and
configuration files of the application.

Remediation:

IAM roles can only be associated at the launch of an instance. To remediate an instance to
add it to a role you must create a new instance.
If the instance has no external dependencies on its current private ip or public addresses
are elastic IPs:

1.  In AWS IAM create a new role. Assign a permissions policy if needed permissions

are already known.

2.  In the AWS console launch a new instance with identical settings to the existing

instance, and ensure that the newly created role is selected.
3.  Shutdown both the existing instance and the new instance.
4.  Detach disks from both instances.
5.  Attach the existing instance disks to the new instance.
6.  Boot the new instance and you should have the same machine, but with the

associated role.

Note: if your environment has dependencies on a dynamically assigned PRIVATE IP
address you can create an AMI from the existing instance, destroy the old one and then
when launching from the AMI, manually assign the previous private IP address.
Note: if your environment has dependencies on a dynamically assigned PUBLIC IP address
there is not a way ensure the address is retained and assign an instance role. Dependencies
on dynamically assigned public IP addresses are a bad practice and, if possible, you may
wish to rebuild the instance with a new elastic IP address and make the investment to
remediate affected systems while assigning the system to a role.

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

AWS provides a support center that can be used for incident notification and response, as
well as technical support and customer services. Create an IAM Role to allow authorized
users to manage incidents with AWS Support.

Rationale:

By implementing least privilege for access control, an IAM Role will require an appropriate
IAM Policy to allow Support Center Access in order to manage Incidents with AWS Support.

Audit:

Using the Amazon unified command line interface:

  List IAM policies, filter for the 'AWSSupportAccess' managed policy, and note the

"Arn" element value:

  aws iam list-policies --query "Policies[?PolicyName == 'AWSSupportAccess']"

  Check if the 'AWSSupportAccess' is attached to any IAM user, group or role:

  aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn <iam_policy_arn>

o  Create the IAM role using the above trust policy:

      aws iam create-role --role-name <aws_support_iam_role> --assume-role-
policy-document file:///tmp/TrustPolicy.json

o  Attach 'AWSSupportAccess' managed policy to the created IAM role:

      aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn <iam_policy_arn> --role-name
<aws_support_iam_role>

Impact:

All AWS Support plans include an unlimited number of account and billing support cases,
with no long-term contracts. Support billing calculations are performed on a per-account
basis for all plans. Enterprise Support plan customers have the option to include multiple
enabled accounts in an aggregated monthly billing calculation. Monthly charges for the
Business and Enterprise support plans are based on each month's AWS usage charges,
subject to a monthly minimum, billed in advance.

1.21 Do not setup access keys during initial user setup for all IAM users
that have a console password (Not Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

AWS console defaults the checkbox for creating access keys to enabled. This results in
many access keys being generated unnecessarily. In addition to unnecessary credentials, it
also generates unnecessary management work in auditing and rotating these keys.

Rationale:

Requiring that additional steps be taken by the user after their profile has been created will
give a stronger indication of intent that access keys are [a] necessary for their work and [b]
once the access key is established on an account that the keys may be in use somewhere in
the organization.

Note: Even if it is known the user will need access keys, require them to create the keys
themselves or put in a support ticket to have the created as a separate step from user
creation.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if access keys are rotated as prescribed:

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console
2.  Click Services
3.  Click IAM
4.  Click on a User
5.  Compare the user creation date to the key 1 creation date.
6.  For any that match, the key was created during initial user setup.

  Keys that were created at the same time as the user profile and do not have a last

used date should be deleted.

Via the CLI

1.  Run the following command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) to generate a list of all IAM users

along with their access keys utilization:

53 | P a g e

  aws iam generate-credential-report

  aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d |
cut -d, -f1,4,9,11,14,16

2.  The output of this command will produce a table similar to the following:

user,password_enabled,access_key_1_active,access_key_1_last_used_date,access_
key_2_active,access_key_2_last_used_date
  elise,false,true,2015-04-16T15:14:00+00:00,false,N/A
  brandon,true,true,N/A,false,N/A
  rakesh,false,false,N/A,false,N/A
  helene,false,true,2015-11-18T17:47:00+00:00,false,N/A
  paras,true,true,2016-08-28T12:04:00+00:00,true,2016-03-04T10:11:00+00:00
  anitha,true,true,2016-06-08T11:43:00+00:00,true,N/A

3.  For any user having access_key_last_used_date set to N/A , ensure that access key

is deleted .

Remediation:

Perform the following to delete access keys that do not pass the audit:

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console:
2.  Click Services
3.  Click IAM
4.  Click on Users
5.  Click on Security Credentials
6.  As an Administrator

  Click on Delete for keys that were created at the same time as the user profile but

have not been used.

7.  As an IAM User

  Click on Delete for keys that were created at the same time as the user profile but

have not been used.

1.22 Ensure IAM policies that allow full "*:*" administrative privileges
are not created (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is
recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant least privilege—that is,
granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need to do
and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks, instead of
allowing full administrative privileges.

Rationale:

It's more secure to start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional
permissions as necessary, rather than starting with permissions that are too lenient and
then trying to tighten them later.

Providing full administrative privileges instead of restricting to the minimum set of
permissions that the user is required to do exposes the resources to potentially unwanted
actions.

IAM policies that have a statement with "Effect": "Allow" with "Action": "*" over
"Resource": "*" should be removed.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine what policies are created:

1.  Run the following to get a list of IAM policies:

  aws iam list-policies --output text

2.  For each policy returned, run the following command to determine if any policies is

allowing full administrative privileges on the account:

  aws iam get-policy-version  --policy-arn <policy_arn> --version-id
<version>

56 | P a g e

3.  In output ensure policy should not have any Statement block with "Effect":

"Allow" and Action set to "*" and Resource set to "*"

Remediation:

Using the GUI, perform the following to detach the policy that has full administrative
privileges:

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

2.  In the navigation pane, click Policies and then search for the policy name found in

the audit step.

3.  Select the policy that needs to be deleted.
4.  In the policy action menu, select first Detach
5.  Select all Users, Groups, Roles that have this policy attached
6.  Click Detach Policy
7.  In the policy action menu, select Detach

Using the CLI, perform the following to detach the policy that has full administrative
privileges as found in the audit step:
1. Lists all IAM users, groups, and roles that the specified managed policy is attached to.
  aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn <policy_arn>

2. Detach the policy from all IAM Users:

  aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name <iam_user> --policy-arn <policy_arn>

3. Detach the policy from all IAM Groups:

  aws iam detach-group-policy --group-name <iam_group> --policy-arn
<policy_arn>

4. Detach the policy from all IAM Roles:

  aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name <iam_role> --policy-arn <policy_arn>

2.1 Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your account and delivers
log files to you. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of
the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the
response elements returned by the AWS service. CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API
calls for an account, including API calls made via the Management Console, SDKs, command
line tools, and higher-level AWS services (such as CloudFormation).

Rationale:

The AWS API call history produced by CloudTrail enables security analysis, resource
change tracking, and compliance auditing. Additionally,

  ensuring that a multi-regions trail exists will ensure that unexpected activity

occurring in otherwise unused regions is detected

  ensuring that a multi-regions trail exists will ensure that Global Service Logging
is enabled for a trail by default to capture recording of events generated on AWS
global services
for a multi-regions trail, ensuring that management events configured for all type of
Read/Writes ensures recording of management operations that are performed on
all resources in an AWS account



Audit:

Perform the following to determine if CloudTrail is enabled for all regions:
Via the management Console

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail

2.  Click on Trails on the left navigation pane

  You will be presented with a list of trails across all regions

3.  Ensure at least one Trail has All specified in the Region column
4.  Click on a trail via the link in the Name column
5.  Ensure Logging is set to ON
6.  Ensure Apply trail to all regions is set to Yes

60 | P a g e

7.  In section Management Events ensure Read/Write Events set to ALL

Via CLI
 aws cloudtrail describe-trails

Ensure IsMultiRegionTrail is set to true

aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <trailname shown in describe-trails>

Ensure IsLogging is set to true

aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name <trailname shown in describe-
trails>

Ensure there is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with IncludeManagementEvents set to
true and ReadWriteType set to All

Remediation:

Perform the following to enable global (Multi-region) CloudTrail logging:
Via the management Console

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail

2.  Click on Trails on the left navigation pane
3.  Click Get Started Now , if presented

  Click Add new trail
  Enter a trail name in the Trail name box
  Set the Apply trail to all regions option to Yes
  Specify an S3 bucket name in the S3 bucket box
  Click Create

4.  If 1 or more trails already exist, select the target trail to enable for global logging
5.  Click the edit icon (pencil) next to Apply trail to all regions , Click Yes and

Click Save.

6.  Click the edit icon (pencil) next to Management Events click All for setting

Read/Write Events and Click Save.

Via CLI
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail_name> --bucket-name
<s3_bucket_for_cloudtrail> --is-multi-region-trail
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail_name> --is-multi-region-trail

61 | P a g e

Note: Creating CloudTrail via CLI without providing any overriding options configures
Management Events to set All type of Read/Writes by default.

Impact:

S3 lifecycle features can be used to manage the accumulation and management of logs over
time. See the following AWS resource for more information on these features:

2.2 Ensure CloudTrail log file validation is enabled (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2

Description:

CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally signed digest file containing a hash of each
log that CloudTrail writes to S3. These digest files can be used to determine whether a log
file was changed, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered the log. It is
recommended that file validation be enabled on all CloudTrails.

Rationale:

Enabling log file validation will provide additional integrity checking of CloudTrail logs.

Audit:

Perform the following on each trail to determine if log file validation is enabled:
Via the management Console

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail

2.  Click on Trails on the left navigation pane
3.  For Every Trail:

  Click on a trail via the link in the Name column
  Under the S3 section, ensure Enable log file validation is set to Yes

Via CLI
aws cloudtrail describe-trails

Ensure LogFileValidationEnabled is set to true for each trail

Remediation:

Perform the following to enable log file validation on a given trail:
Via the management Console

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail

2.  Click on Trails on the left navigation pane
3.  Click on target trail

63 | P a g e

4.  Within the S3 section click on the edit icon (pencil)

2.3 Ensure the S3 bucket used to store CloudTrail logs is not publicly
accessible (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

CloudTrail logs a record of every API call made in your AWS account. These logs file are
stored in an S3 bucket. It is recommended that the bucket policy, or access control list
(ACL), applied to the S3 bucket that CloudTrail logs to prevents public access to the
CloudTrail logs.

Rationale:

Allowing public access to CloudTrail log content may aid an adversary in identifying
weaknesses in the affected account's use or configuration.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if any public access is granted to an S3 bucket via an
ACL or S3 bucket policy:
Via the Management Console

1.  Go to the Amazon CloudTrail console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home

2.  In the API activity history pane on the left, click Trails
3.  In the Trails pane, note the bucket names in the S3 bucket column
4.  Go to Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home
5.  For each bucket noted in step 3, right-click on the bucket and click Properties
6.  In the Properties pane, click the Permissions tab.
7.  The tab shows a list of grants, one row per grant, in the bucket ACL. Each row

identifies the grantee and the permissions granted.

8.  Ensure no rows exists that have the Grantee set to Everyone or the Grantee set to

Any Authenticated User.

9.  If the Edit bucket policy button is present, click it to review the bucket policy.
10. Ensure the policy does not contain a Statement having an Effect set to Allow and a

Principal set to "*" or {"AWS" : "*"}

Via CLI:

1.  Get the name of the S3 bucket that CloudTrail is logging to:

65 | P a g e

  aws cloudtrail describe-trails --query 'trailList[*].S3BucketName'

2.  Ensure the AllUsers principal is not granted privileges to that <bucket> :

  aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <s3_bucket_for_cloudtrail> --query
'Grants[?Grantee.URI== `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers` ]'

3.  Ensure the AuthenticatedUsers principal is not granted privileges to that <bucket>

:

  aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <s3_bucket_for_cloudtrail> --query
'Grants[?Grantee.URI== `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/Authenticated
Users` ]'

4.  Get the S3 Bucket Policy

  aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <s3_bucket_for_cloudtrail>

5.  Ensure the policy does not contain a Statement having an Effect set to Allow and a

Principal set to "*" or {"AWS" : "*"}

Note: Principal set to "*" or {"AWS" : "*"} allows anonymous access.

Remediation:

Perform the following to remove any public access that has been granted to the bucket via
an ACL or S3 bucket policy:

1.  Go to Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home
2.  Right-click on the bucket and click Properties
3.  In the Properties pane, click the Permissions tab.
4.  The tab shows a list of grants, one row per grant, in the bucket ACL. Each row

identifies the grantee and the permissions granted.

5.  Select the row that grants permission to Everyone or Any Authenticated User
6.  Uncheck all the permissions granted to Everyone or Any Authenticated User (click

x to delete the row).

7.  Click Save to save the ACL.
8.  If the Edit bucket policy button is present, click it.
9.  Remove any Statement having an Effect set to Allow and a Principal set to "*" or

{"AWS" : "*"}.

Default Value:

By default, S3 buckets are not publicly accessible

2.4 Ensure CloudTrail trails are integrated with CloudWatch Logs
(Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls made in a given AWS account.
The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the
source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements
returned by the AWS service. CloudTrail uses Amazon S3 for log file storage and delivery,
so log files are stored durably. In addition to capturing CloudTrail logs within a specified S3
bucket for long term analysis, realtime analysis can be performed by configuring CloudTrail
to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. For a trail that is enabled in all regions in an account,
CloudTrail sends log files from all those regions to a CloudWatch Logs log group. It is
recommended that CloudTrail logs be sent to CloudWatch Logs.

Note: The intent of this recommendation is to ensure AWS account activity is being
captured, monitored, and appropriately alarmed on. CloudWatch Logs is a native way to
accomplish this using AWS services but does not preclude the use of an alternate solution.

Rationale:

Sending CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs will facilitate real-time and historic activity
logging based on user, API, resource, and IP address, and provides opportunity to establish
alarms and notifications for anomalous or sensitivity account activity.

Audit:

Perform the following to ensure CloudTrail is configured as prescribed:
Via the AWS management Console

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/

2.  Under All Buckets , click on the target bucket you wish to evaluate
3.  Click Properties on the top right of the console
4.  Click Trails in the left menu
5.  Ensure a CloudWatch Logs log group is configured and has a recent (~one day old)

Last log file delivered timestamp.

Via CLI

68 | P a g e

1.  Run the following command to get a listing of existing trails:

  aws cloudtrail describe-trails

2.  Ensure CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn is not empty and note the value of the Name

property.

3.  Using the noted value of the Name property, run the following command:

  aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <trail_name>

4.  Ensure the LatestcloudwatchLogdDeliveryTime property is set to a recent (~one

day old) timestamp.

Remediation:

Perform the following to establish the prescribed state:
Via the AWS management Console

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/

2.  Under All Buckets, click on the target bucket you wish to evaluate
3.  Click Properties on the top right of the console
4.  Click Trails in the left menu
5.  Click on each trail where no CloudWatch Logs are defined
6.  Go to the CloudWatch Logs section and click on Configure
7.  Define a new or select an existing log group
8.  Click on Continue
9.  Configure IAM Role which will deliver CloudTrail events to CloudWatch Logs

o  Create/Select an IAM Role and Policy Name
o  Click Allow to continue

Via CLI
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail_name> --cloudwatch-logs-log-group-
arn <cloudtrail_log_group_arn> --cloudwatch-logs-role-arn
<cloudtrail_cloudwatchLogs_role_arn>

Impact:

Note: By default, CloudWatch Logs will store Logs indefinitely unless a specific retention
period is defined for the log group. When choosing the number of days to retain, keep in
mind the average days it takes an organization to realize they have been breached is 210
days (at the time of this writing). Since additional time is required to research a breach, a

69 | P a g e

minimum 365 day retention policy allows time for detection and research. You may also
wish to archive the logs to a cheaper storage service rather than simply deleting them. See
the following AWS resource to manage CloudWatch Logs retention periods:

2.5 Ensure AWS Config is enabled in all regions (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

AWS Config is a web service that performs configuration management of supported AWS
resources within your account and delivers log files to you. The recorded information
includes the configuration item (AWS resource), relationships between configuration items
(AWS resources), any configuration changes between resources. It is recommended to
enable AWS Config be enabled in all regions.

Rationale:

The AWS configuration item history captured by AWS Config enables security analysis,
resource change tracking, and compliance auditing.

Audit:

Process to evaluate AWS Config configuration per region
Via AWS Management Console:

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/.

2.  On the top right of the console select target Region.
3.  If presented with Setup AWS Config - follow remediation procedure:
4.  On the Resource inventory page, Click on edit (the gear icon). The Set Up AWS

Config page appears.

5.  Ensure 1 or both check-boxes under "All Resources" is checked.



Include global resources related to IAM resources - which needs to be enabled in 1
region only

6.  Ensure the correct S3 bucket has been defined.
7.  Ensure the correct SNS topic has been defined.
8.  Repeat steps 2 to 7 for each region.

Via AWS Command Line Interface:

1.  Run this command to show all AWS Config recorders and their properties:

aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders

71 | P a g e

2.  Evaluate the output to ensure that there's at least one recorder for which

recordingGroup object includes "allSupported": true AND
"includeGlobalResourceTypes": true

Note: There is one more parameter "ResourceTypes" in recordingGroup object. We don't
need to check the same as whenever we set "allSupported": true, AWS enforces resource
types to be empty ("ResourceTypes":[])
Sample Output:
{
    "ConfigurationRecorders": [
        {
            "recordingGroup": {
                "allSupported": true,
                "resourceTypes": [],
                "includeGlobalResourceTypes": true
            },
            "roleARN": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_Account_ID>:role/service-
role/<config-role-name>",
            "name": "default"
        }
    ]
}

3.  Run this command to show the status for all AWS Config recorders:

aws configservice describe-configuration-recorder-status

4.  In the output, find recorders with name key matching the recorders that met criteria

in step 2. Ensure that at least one of them includes "recording": true and

2.6 Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3
bucket (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

S3 Bucket Access Logging generates a log that contains access records for each request
made to your S3 bucket. An access log record contains details about the request, such as the
request type, the resources specified in the request worked, and the time and date the
request was processed. It is recommended that bucket access logging be enabled on the
CloudTrail S3 bucket.

Rationale:

By enabling S3 bucket logging on target S3 buckets, it is possible to capture all events
which may affect objects within an target buckets. Configuring logs to be placed in a
separate bucket allows access to log information which can be useful in security and
incident response workflows.

Audit:

Perform the following ensure the CloudTrail S3 bucket has access logging is enabled:
Via the management Console

1.  Go to the Amazon CloudTrail console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home
2.  In the API activity history pane on the left, click Trails
3.  In the Trails pane, note the bucket names in the S3 bucket column
4.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3.

5.  Under All Buckets click on a target S3 bucket
6.  Click on Properties in the top right of the console
7.  Under Bucket: _ <bucket_name> _ click on Logging
8.  Ensure Enabled is checked.

Via CLI

1.  Get the name of the S3 bucket that CloudTrail is logging to:

aws cloudtrail describe-trails --query 'trailList[*].S3BucketName'

74 | P a g e

2.  Ensure Bucket Logging is enabled:

aws s3api get-bucket-logging --bucket <s3_bucket_for_cloudtrail>

Ensure command does not returns empty output.
Sample Output for a bucket with logging enabled:

{
    "LoggingEnabled": {
        "TargetPrefix": "<Prefix_Test>",
        "TargetBucket": "<Bucket_name_for_Storing_Logs>"
    }
}

Remediation:

2.7 Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest using KMS CMKs
(Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2

Description:

AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for an account and makes those
logs available to users and resources in accordance with IAM policies. AWS Key
Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that helps create and control the
encryption keys used to encrypt account data, and uses Hardware Security Modules
(HSMs) to protect the security of encryption keys. CloudTrail logs can be configured to
leverage server side encryption (SSE) and KMS customer created master keys (CMK) to
further protect CloudTrail logs. It is recommended that CloudTrail be configured to use
SSE-KMS.

Rationale:

Configuring CloudTrail to use SSE-KMS provides additional confidentiality controls on log
data as a given user must have S3 read permission on the corresponding log bucket and
must be granted decrypt permission by the CMK policy.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if CloudTrail is configured to use SSE-KMS:
Via the Management Console

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail

2.  In the left navigation pane, choose Trails .
3.  Select a Trail
4.  Under the S3 section, ensure Encrypt log files is set to Yes and a KMS key ID is

specified in the KSM Key Id field.

Via CLI

1.  Run the following command:

  aws cloudtrail describe-trails

77 | P a g e

2.  For each trail listed, SSE-KMS is enabled if the trail has a KmsKeyId property defined.

Remediation:

Perform the following to configure CloudTrail to use SSE-KMS:
Via the Management Console

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail

2.  In the left navigation pane, choose Trails .
3.  Click on a Trail
4.  Under the S3 section click on the edit button (pencil icon)
5.  Click Advanced
6.  Select an existing CMK from the KMS key Id drop-down menu

  Note: Ensure the CMK is located in the same region as the S3 bucket
  Note: You will need to apply a KMS Key policy on the selected CMK in order for
CloudTrail as a service to encrypt and decrypt log files using the CMK provided.
Steps are provided here for editing the selected CMK Key policy

7.  Click Save
8.  You will see a notification message stating that you need to have decrypt

permissions on the specified KMS key to decrypt log files.

9.  Click Yes

Via CLI
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail_name>  --kms-id
<cloudtrail_kms_key>
aws kms put-key-policy --key-id <cloudtrail_kms_key> --policy
<cloudtrail_kms_key_policy>

Impact:

Customer created keys incur an additional cost. See

2.8 Ensure rotation for customer created CMKs is enabled (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2

Description:

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) allows customers to rotate the backing key which is
key material stored within the KMS which is tied to the key ID of the Customer Created
customer master key (CMK). It is the backing key that is used to perform cryptographic
operations such as encryption and decryption. Automated key rotation currently retains all
prior backing keys so that decryption of encrypted data can take place transparently. It is
recommended that CMK key rotation be enabled.

Rationale:

Rotating encryption keys helps reduce the potential impact of a compromised key as data
encrypted with a new key cannot be accessed with a previous key that may have been
exposed.

Audit:

Via the Management Console:

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam.

2.  In the left navigation pane, choose Encryption Keys .
3.  Select a customer created master key (CMK)
4.  Under the Key Policy section, move down to Key Rotation .
5.  Ensure the Rotate this key every year checkbox is checked.

Via CLI

1.  Run the following command to get a list of all keys and their associated KeyIds

  aws kms list-keys

2.  For each key, note the KeyId and run the following command

  aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id <kms_key_id>

3.  Ensure KeyRotationEnabled is set to true

2.9 Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2

Description:

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic
going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. After you've created a flow log, you can
view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended that VPC Flow
Logs be enabled for packet "Rejects" for VPCs.

Rationale:

VPC Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC and can be
used to detect anomalous traffic or insight during security workflows.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if VPC Flow logs is enabled:
Via the Management Console:

1.  Sign into the management console
2.  Select Services then VPC
3.  In the left navigation pane, select Your VPCs
4.  Select a VPC
5.  In the right pane, select the Flow Logs tab.
6.  Ensure a Log Flow exists that has Active in the Status column.

Remediation:

Perform the following to determine if VPC Flow logs is enabled:
Via the Management Console:

1.  Sign into the management console
2.  Select Services then VPC
3.  In the left navigation pane, select Your VPCs
4.  Select a VPC
5.  In the right pane, select the Flow Logs tab.
6.  If no Flow Log exists, click Create Flow Log
7.  For Filter, select Reject
8.  Enter in a Role and Destination Log Group
9.  Click Create Log Flow

83 | P a g e

10. Click on CloudWatch Logs Group

Note: Setting the filter to "Reject" will dramatically reduce the logging data accumulation
for this recommendation and provide sufficient information for the purposes of breach
detection, research and remediation. However, during periods of least privilege security
group engineering, setting this the filter to "All" can be very helpful in discovering existing
traffic flows required for proper operation of an already running environment.

Impact:

By default, CloudWatch Logs will store Logs indefinitely unless a specific retention period
is defined for the log group. When choosing the number of days to retain, keep in mind the
average days it takes an organization to realize they have been breached is 210 days (at the
time of this writing). Since additional time is required to research a breach, a minimum 365
day retention policy allows time for detection and research. You may also wish to archive
the logs to a cheaper storage service rather than simply deleting them. See the following
AWS resource to manage CloudWatch Logs retention periods:

Notes:

Changed title from

"Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all applicable regions"

to

"Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs"

For these reasons:

1.  Flow logs cannot be enabled for regions, only for VPCs
2.  The statement did not define an "Applicable Region" and did not clarify "all VPCs in

applicable regions"

3.  All other benchmark recommendations appear to assume that you apply them "any

actively used configuration or resource" or "All resources" - so specifying

84 | P a g e

"applicable" to mean "active" or "compliant with the benchmark" seems
unnecessary.

3.1 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for unauthorized API calls
(Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is
recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for unauthorized API calls.

Rationale:

Monitoring unauthorized API calls will help reveal application errors and may reduce time
to detect malicious activity.

Audit:

Perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail
with prescribed metric filters and alarms configured:

1.  Identify the log group name configured for use with active multi-region CloudTrail:

  List all CloudTrails: aws cloudtrail describe-trails



Identify Multi region Cloudtrails: Trails with "IsMultiRegionTrail" set to
true

  From value associated with CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn note

<cloudtrail_log_group_name>

Example: for CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn that looks like
arn:aws:logs:<region>:<aws_account_number>:log-group:NewGroup:*,
<cloudtrail_log_group_name> would be NewGroup

  Ensure Identified Multi region CloudTrail is active

aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <Name of a Multi-region CloudTrail>
ensure IsLogging is set to TRUE

  Ensure identified Multi-region Cloudtrail captures all Management Events

87 | P a g e

aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name <trailname shown in describe-
trails>
Ensure there is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with IncludeManagementEvents set to
true and ReadWriteType set to All

2.  Get a list of all associated metric filters for this <cloudtrail_log_group_name>:

aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name
"<cloudtrail_log_group_name>"

3.  Ensure the output from the above command contains the following:

"filterPattern":  "{ ($.errorCode = "*UnauthorizedOperation") || ($.errorCode
= "AccessDenied*") }"

4.  Note the <unauthorized_api_calls_metric> value associated with the

filterPattern found in step 3.

5.  Get a list of CloudWatch alarms and filter on the

<unauthorized_api_calls_metric> captured in step 4.

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query 'MetricAlarms[?MetricName==
`<unauthorized_api_calls_metric>`]'

6.  Note the AlarmActions value - this will provide the SNS topic ARN value.
7.  Ensure there is at least one active subscriber to the SNS topic

aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn>

at least one subscription should have "SubscriptionArn" with valid aws ARN.

Example of valid "SubscriptionArn":
"arn:aws:sns:<region>:<aws_account_number>:<SnsTopicName>:<SubscriptionID>"

Remediation:

Perform the following to setup the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription:

1.  Create a metric filter based on filter pattern provided which checks for

unauthorized API calls and the <cloudtrail_log_group_name> taken from audit
step 1.

aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name <cloudtrail_log_group_name> --
filter-name  `<unauthorized_api_calls_metric>`  --metric-transformations
metricName= `<unauthorized_api_calls_metric>`

88 | P a g e

,metricNamespace='CISBenchmark',metricValue=1 --filter-pattern '{
($.errorCode = "*UnauthorizedOperation") || ($.errorCode = "AccessDenied*")
}'

Note: You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings. Using the same
metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.

2.  Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify

aws sns create-topic --name <sns_topic_name>

Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the same topic for all
monitoring alarms.

3.  Create an SNS subscription to the topic created in step 2

aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn> --protocol <protocol_for_sns> -
-notification-endpoint <sns_subscription_endpoints>

Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the SNS subscription for all
monitoring alarms.

4.  Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter created in

step 1 and an SNS topic created in step 2

aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name
`<unauthorized_api_calls_alarm>`  --metric-name
`<unauthorized_api_calls_metric>`  --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1
--comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 --
namespace 'CISBenchmark' --alarm-actions <sns_topic_arn>

Impact:

This alert may be triggered by normal read-only console activities that attempt to
opportunistically gather optional information, but gracefully fail if they don't have
permissions.

If an excessive number of alerts are being generated then an organization may wish to
consider adding read access to the limited IAM user permissions simply to quiet the alerts.

In some cases doing this may allow the users to actually view some areas of the system -
any additional access given should be reviewed for alignment with the original limited IAM
user intent.

3.2 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for Management Console
sign-in without MFA (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is
recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for console logins that are not
protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Rationale:

Monitoring for single-factor console logins will increase visibility into accounts that are not
protected by MFA.

Audit:

Perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail
with prescribed metric filters and alarms configured:

1.  Identify the log group name configured for use with active multi-region CloudTrail:

  List all CloudTrails:

aws cloudtrail describe-trails



Ensure there is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with IncludeManagementEvents set to
true and ReadWriteType set to All

2.  Get a list of all associated metric filters for this <cloudtrail_log_group_name>:

aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name
"<cloudtrail_log_group_name>"

3.  Ensure the output from the above command contains the following:

"filterPattern": "{ ($.eventName = "ConsoleLogin") &&
($.additionalEventData.MFAUsed != "Yes") }"

4.  Note the <no_mfa_console_signin_metric> value associated with the

filterPattern found in step 3.

5.  Get a list of CloudWatch alarms and filter on the <no_mfa_console_signin_metric>

captured in step 4.

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query 'MetricAlarms[?MetricName==
`<no_mfa_console_signin_metric>`]'

6.  Note the AlarmActions value - this will provide the SNS topic ARN value.
7.  Ensure there is at least one active subscriber to the SNS topic

aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn>

at least one subscription should have "SubscriptionArn" with valid aws ARN.

Example of valid "SubscriptionArn":
"arn:aws:sns:<region>:<aws_account_number>:<SnsTopicName>:<SubscriptionID>"

Remediation:

Perform the following to setup the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription:

1.  Create a metric filter based on filter pattern provided which checks for AWS

Management Console sign-in without MFA and the <cloudtrail_log_group_name>
taken from audit step 1.

aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name <cloudtrail_log_group_name> --
filter-name  `<no_mfa_console_signin_metric>`  --metric-transformations

($.eventName = "ConsoleLogin") && ($.additionalEventData.MFAUsed != "Yes") }'

Note: You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings. Using the same
metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.

2.  Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify

aws sns create-topic --name <sns_topic_name>

Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the same topic for all
monitoring alarms.

3.  Create an SNS subscription to the topic created in step 2

aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn> --protocol <protocol_for_sns> -
-notification-endpoint <sns_subscription_endpoints>

Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the SNS subscription for all
monitoring alarms.

4.  Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter created in

step 1 and an SNS topic created in step 2

aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name  `<no_mfa_console_signin_alarm>`
--metric-name  `<no_mfa_console_signin_metric>`  --statistic Sum --period 300
--threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is
recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established changes made to Identity and
Access Management (IAM) policies.

Rationale:

Monitoring changes to IAM policies will help ensure authentication and authorization
controls remain intact.

Audit:

Perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail
with prescribed metric filters and alarms configured:

1.  Identify the log group name configured for use with active multi-region CloudTrail:

  List all CloudTrails:

aws cloudtrail describe-trails



Identify Multi region Cloudtrails: Trails with "IsMultiRegionTrail" set to
true

  From value associated with CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn note

<cloudtrail_log_group_name>

Example: for CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn that looks like
arn:aws:logs:<region>:<aws_account_number>:log-group:NewGroup:*,
<cloudtrail_log_group_name> would be NewGroup

  Ensure Identified Multi region CloudTrail is active

aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <Name of a Multi-region CloudTrail>
ensure IsLogging is set to TRUE

99 | P a g e

  Ensure identified Multi-region Cloudtrail captures all Management Events

aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name <trailname shown in describe-
trails>
Ensure there is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with IncludeManagementEvents set to
true and ReadWriteType set to All

2.  Get a list of all associated metric filters for this <cloudtrail_log_group_name>:

aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name
"<cloudtrail_log_group_name>"

3.  Ensure the output from the above command contains the following:

"filterPattern":
"{($.eventName=DeleteGroupPolicy)||($.eventName=DeleteRolePolicy)||($.eventNa

3.9 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for AWS Config
configuration changes (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2

Description:

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is
recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to
CloudTrail's configurations.

Rationale:

Monitoring changes to AWS Config configuration will help ensure sustained visibility of
configuration items within the AWS account.

Audit:

Perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail
with prescribed metric filters and alarms configured:

1.  Identify the log group name configured for use with active multi-region CloudTrail:

  List all CloudTrails: aws cloudtrail describe-trails



Identify Multi region Cloudtrails: Trails with "IsMultiRegionTrail" set to
true

  From value associated with CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn note

<cloudtrail_log_group_name>

Example: for CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn that looks like
arn:aws:logs:<region>:<aws_account_number>:log-group:NewGroup:*,
<cloudtrail_log_group_name> would be NewGroup

  Ensure Identified Multi region CloudTrail is active

aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <Name of a Multi-region CloudTrail>
ensure IsLogging is set to TRUE

  Ensure identified Multi-region Cloudtrail captures all Management Events

119 | P a g e

aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name <trailname shown in describe-
trails>
Ensure there is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with IncludeManagementEvents set to
true and ReadWriteType set to All

2.  Get a list of all associated metric filters for this <cloudtrail_log_group_name>:

aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name
"<cloudtrail_log_group_name>"

3.  Ensure the output from the above command contains the following:

"filterPattern": "{ ($.eventSource = config.amazonaws.com) &&
(($.eventName=StopConfigurationRecorder)||($.eventName=DeleteDeliveryChannel)
||($.eventName=PutDeliveryChannel)||($.eventName=PutConfigurationRecorder))
}"

4.  Note the <aws_config_changes_metric> value associated with the filterPattern

found in step 3.

5.  Get a list of CloudWatch alarms and filter on the <aws_config_changes_metric>

captured in step 4.

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query 'MetricAlarms[?MetricName==
`<aws_config_changes_metric>`]'

6.  Note the AlarmActions value - this will provide the SNS topic ARN value.
7.  Ensure there is at least one active subscriber to the SNS topic

aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn>

at least one subscription should have "SubscriptionArn" with valid aws ARN.

Example of valid "SubscriptionArn":
"arn:aws:sns:<region>:<aws_account_number>:<SnsTopicName>:<SubscriptionID>"

Remediation:

Perform the following to setup the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription:

1.  Create a metric filter based on filter pattern provided which checks for AWS

Configuration changes and the <cloudtrail_log_group_name> taken from audit
step 1.

120 | P a g e

aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name <cloudtrail_log_group_name> --
filter-name  `<aws_config_changes_metric>`  --metric-transformations
metricName= `<aws_config_changes_metric>`
,metricNamespace='CISBenchmark',metricValue=1 --filter-pattern '{
($.eventSource = config.amazonaws.com) &&
(($.eventName=StopConfigurationRecorder)||($.eventName=DeleteDeliveryChannel)
||($.eventName=PutDeliveryChannel)||($.eventName=PutConfigurationRecorder))
}'

Note: You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings. Using the same
metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.

2.  Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify

aws sns create-topic --name <sns_topic_name>

Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the same topic for all
monitoring alarms.

3.  Create an SNS subscription to topic created in step 2

aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn> --protocol <protocol_for_sns> -
-notification-endpoint <sns_subscription_endpoints>

Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the SNS subscription for all
monitoring alarms.

4.  Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter created in

step 1 and an SNS topic created in step 2

aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name  `<aws_config_changes_alarm>`  -
-metric-name  `<aws_config_changes_metric>`  --statistic Sum --period 300 --
threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-
periods 1 --namespace 'CISBenchmark' --alarm-actions <sns_topic_arn>

3.14 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for VPC changes (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is possible to
have more than 1 VPC within an account, in addition it is also possible to create a peer
connection between 2 VPCs enabling network traffic to route between VPCs. It is
recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes made to VPCs.

Rationale:

Monitoring changes to IAM policies will help ensure authentication and authorization
controls remain intact.

Audit:

Perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail
with prescribed metric filters and alarms configured:

1.  Identify the log group name configured for use with active multi-region CloudTrail:

  List all CloudTrails:

aws cloudtrail describe-trails



Identify Multi region Cloudtrails: Trails with "IsMultiRegionTrail" set to
true

  From value associated with CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn note

<cloudtrail_log_group_name>

Example: for CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn that looks like
arn:aws:logs:<region>:<aws_account_number>:log-group:NewGroup:*,
<cloudtrail_log_group_name> would be NewGroup

  Ensure Identified Multi region CloudTrail is active

aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <Name of a Multi-region CloudTrail>
ensure IsLogging is set to TRUE

139 | P a g e

  Ensure identified Multi-region Cloudtrail captures all Management Events

aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name <trailname shown in describe-
trails>
Ensure there is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with IncludeManagementEvents set to
true and ReadWriteType set to All

2.  Get a list of all associated metric filters for this <cloudtrail_log_group_name>:

aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name
"<cloudtrail_log_group_name>"

3.  Ensure the output from the above command contains the following:

"filterPattern": "{ ($.eventName = CreateVpc) || ($.eventName = DeleteVpc) ||
($.eventName = ModifyVpcAttribute) || ($.eventName =
AcceptVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = CreateVpcPeeringConnection) ||
($.eventName = DeleteVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName =
RejectVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = AttachClassicLinkVpc) ||
($.eventName = DetachClassicLinkVpc) || ($.eventName = DisableVpcClassicLink)
|| ($.eventName = EnableVpcClassicLink) }"

4.  Note the <vpc_changes_metric> value associated with the filterPattern found in

step 3.

5.  Get a list of CloudWatch alarms and filter on the <vpc_changes_metric> captured in

step 4.

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query 'MetricAlarms[?MetricName==
`<vpc_changes_metric>`]'

6.  Note the AlarmActions value - this will provide the SNS topic ARN value.
7.  Ensure there is at least one active subscriber to the SNS topic

aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn>

at least one subscription should have "SubscriptionArn" with valid aws ARN.

Example of valid "SubscriptionArn":
"arn:aws:sns:<region>:<aws_account_number>:<SnsTopicName>:<SubscriptionID>"

Remediation:

Perform the following to setup the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription:

1.  Create a metric filter based on filter pattern provided which checks for VPC changes

and the <cloudtrail_log_group_name> taken from audit step 1.

140 | P a g e

aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name <cloudtrail_log_group_name> --
filter-name  `<vpc_changes_metric>`  --metric-transformations metricName=
`<vpc_changes_metric>` ,metricNamespace='CISBenchmark',metricValue=1 --
filter-pattern '{ ($.eventName = CreateVpc) || ($.eventName = DeleteVpc) ||
($.eventName = ModifyVpcAttribute) || ($.eventName =
AcceptVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = CreateVpcPeeringConnection) ||
($.eventName = DeleteVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName =
RejectVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = AttachClassicLinkVpc) ||
($.eventName = DetachClassicLinkVpc) || ($.eventName = DisableVpcClassicLink)
|| ($.eventName = EnableVpcClassicLink) }'

Note: You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings. Using the same
metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.

2.  Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify

aws sns create-topic --name <sns_topic_name>

Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the same topic for all
monitoring alarms.

3.  Create an SNS subscription to the topic created in step 2

aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn> --protocol <protocol_for_sns> -
-notification-endpoint <sns_subscription_endpoints>

Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the SNS subscription for all
monitoring alarms.

4.  Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter created in

step 1 and an SNS topic created in step 2

aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name  `<vpc_changes_alarm>`  --
metric-name  `<vpc_changes_metric>`  --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold
1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1
--namespace 'CISBenchmark' --alarm-actions <sns_topic_arn>

4 Networking

This section contains recommendations for configuring security-related aspects of the
default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
(Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 1

Description:

Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS
resources. It is recommended that no security group allows unrestricted ingress access to
port 22 .

Rationale:

Removing unfettered connectivity to remote console services, such as SSH, reduces a
server's exposure to risk.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if the account is configured as prescribed:

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home

2.  In the left pane, click Security Groups
3.  For each security group, perform the following:
4.  Select the security group
5.  Click the Inbound Rules tab
6.  Ensure no rule exists that has a port range that includes port 22 and has a Source of

0.0.0.0/0

Note: A Port value of ALL or a port range such as 0-1024 are inclusive of port 22 .

Remediation:

Perform the following to implement the prescribed state:

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home

143 | P a g e

2.  In the left pane, click Security Groups
3.  For each security group, perform the following:
4.  Select the security group
5.  Click the Inbound Rules tab
6.  Identify the rules to be removed
7.  Click the x in the Remove column
8.  Click Save

Impact:

For updating an existing environment, care should be taken to ensure that administrators
currently relying on an existing ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 have access to ports 22 and/or 3389
through another security group.

CIS Controls:

9.2 Ensure Only Approved Ports, Protocols and Services Are Running
Ensure that only network ports, protocols, and services listening on a system with
validated business needs, are running on each system.

146 | P a g e

4.3 Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic
(Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2

Description:

A VPC comes with a default security group whose initial settings deny all inbound traffic,
allow all outbound traffic, and allow all traffic between instances assigned to the security
group. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is
automatically assigned to this default security group. Security groups provide stateful
filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that the
default security group restrict all traffic.

The default VPC in every region should have its default security group updated to comply.
Any newly created VPCs will automatically contain a default security group that will need
remediation to comply with this recommendation.

NOTE: When implementing this recommendation, VPC flow logging is invaluable in
determining the least privilege port access required by systems to work properly because it
can log all packet acceptances and rejections occurring under the current security groups.
This dramatically reduces the primary barrier to least privilege engineering - discovering
the minimum ports required by systems in the environment. Even if the VPC flow logging
recommendation in this benchmark is not adopted as a permanent security measure, it
should be used during any period of discovery and engineering for least privileged security
groups.

Rationale:

Configuring all VPC default security groups to restrict all traffic will encourage least
privilege security group development and mindful placement of AWS resources into
security groups which will in-turn reduce the exposure of those resources.

Audit:

Perform the following to determine if the account is configured as prescribed:
Security Group State

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home

2.  Repeat the next steps for all VPCs - including the default VPC in each AWS region:

147 | P a g e

3.  In the left pane, click Security Groups
4.  For each default security group, perform the following:
5.  Select the default security group
6.  Click the Inbound Rules tab
7.  Ensure no rule exist
8.  Click the Outbound Rules tab
9.  Ensure no rules exist

Security Group Members

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home

2.  Repeat the next steps for all default groups in all VPCs - including the default VPC in

each AWS region:

3.  In the left pane, click Security Groups
4.  Copy the id of the default security group.
5.  Change to the EC2 Management Console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home

6.  In the filter column type 'Security Group ID : < security group id from #4 >'

Remediation:

Security Group Members
Perform the following to implement the prescribed state:

1.  Identify AWS resources that exist within the default security group
2.  Create a set of least privilege security groups for those resources
3.  Place the resources in those security groups
4.  Remove the resources noted in #1 from the default security group

Security Group State

1.  Login to the AWS Management Console at

https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home

2.  Repeat the next steps for all VPCs - including the default VPC in each AWS region:
3.  In the left pane, click Security Groups
4.  For each default security group, perform the following:
5.  Select the default security group
6.  Click the Inbound Rules tab
7.  Remove any inbound rules
8.  Click the Outbound Rules tab
9.  Remove any inbound rules

148 | P a g e

Recommended:
IAM groups allow you to edit the "name" field. After remediating default groups rules for all
VPCs in all regions, edit this field to add text similar to "DO NOT USE. DO NOT ADD RULES"

Impact:

Implementing this recommendation in an existing VPC containing operating resources
requires extremely careful migration planning as the default security groups are likely to
be enabling many ports that are unknown. Enabling VPC flow logging (of accepts) in an
existing environment that is known to be breach free will reveal the current pattern of
ports being used for each instance to communicate successfully.

4.4 Ensure routing tables for VPC peering are "least access" (Not Scored)

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2

Description:

Once a VPC peering connection is established, routing tables must be updated to establish
any connections between the peered VPCs. These routes can be as specific as desired - even
peering a VPC to only a single host on the other side of the connection.

Rationale:

Being highly selective in peering routing tables is a very effective way of minimizing the
impact of breach as resources outside of these routes are inaccessible to the peered VPC.

Audit:

Review routing tables of peered VPCs for whether they route all subnets of each VPC and
whether that is necessary to accomplish the intended purposes for peering the VPCs.
Via CLI:

1.  List all the route tables from a VPC and check if "GatewayId" is pointing to a

<peering_connection_id> (e.g. pcx-1a2b3c4d) and if "DestinationCidrBlock" is as
specific as desired.

aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filter "Name=vpc-id,Values=<vpc_id>" --query
"RouteTables[*].{RouteTableId:RouteTableId, VpcId:VpcId, Routes:Routes,
AssociatedSubnets:Associations[*].SubnetId}"

Remediation:

Remove and add route table entries to ensure that the least number of subnets or hosts as
is required to accomplish the purpose for peering are routable.
Via CLI:

1.  For each <route_table_id> containing routes non compliant with your routing policy
(which grants more than desired "least access"), delete the non compliant route:

aws ec2 delete-route --route-table-id <route_table_id> --destination-cidr-
block <non_compliant_destination_CIDR>

150 | P a g e

2.  Create a new compliant route:

aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id <route_table_id> --destination-cidr-
block <compliant_destination_CIDR> --vpc-peering-connection-id
<peering_connection_id>
