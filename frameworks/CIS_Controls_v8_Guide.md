CIS Controls v8Overview

Introduction

The CIS Controls® started as a simple grassroots activity to identify the most common
and important real-world cyber-attacks that affect enterprises every day, translate that
knowledge and experience into positive, constructive action for defenders, and then
share that information with a wider audience. The original goals were modest—to help
people and enterprises focus their attention and get started on the most important
steps to defend themselves from the attacks that really mattered.

Led by the Center for Internet Security® (CIS®), the CIS Controls have matured into an
international community of volunteer individuals and institutions that:

•  Share insights into attacks and attackers, identify root causes, and translate that

into classes of defensive action

•  Create and share tools, working aids, and stories of adoption and problem-solving

•  Map the CIS Controls to regulatory and compliance frameworks in order to ensure

alignment and bring collective priority and focus to them

•

Identify common problems and barriers (like initial assessment and implementation
roadmaps), and solve them as a community

The CIS Controls reflect the combined knowledge of experts from every part of the
ecosystem (companies, governments, individuals), with every role (threat responders
and analysts, technologists, information technology (IT) operators and defenders,
vulnerability-finders, tool makers, solution providers, users, policy-makers, auditors,
etc.), and across many sectors (government, power, defense, finance, transportation,
academia, consulting, security, IT, etc.), who have banded together to create, adopt, and
support the CIS Controls.

Evolution of the CIS Controls

The CIS Controls started like many similar activities; we gathered experts together,
and shared and argued until we reached an agreement. This can be very valuable,
depending on the people at the table and their experience. Through documenting and
sharing the output, all enterprises can benefit from the work of people they cannot
hire or even meet. You can improve the outcome (and your confidence in it) through
selecting experts that represent a wide range of knowledge, bringing consistency to the
process, and ensuring use of the best-available information (especially about attacks).
In the end, you are still depending on the good judgment of a relatively small group of
people, captured in an informal and narrative way.

At CIS, we have been on a multi-year path to bring more data, rigor, and transparency
to the process of best practice recommendations (the CIS Benchmarks™ and the
CIS Controls). All of these elements are essential to the maturation of a science to
underlie cyber defense; and, all are necessary to allow the tailoring and “negotiation” of
security actions applicable in specific cases, and as required through specific security
frameworks, regulations, and similar oversight schemes.

Overview

Page 1

CIS Controls v8In the earliest versions of the CIS Controls, we used a standard list of publicly known
attacks as a simple and informal test of the usefulness of specific recommendations.
Starting in 2013, we worked with the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)
team to map the results of their large-scale data analysis directly to the CIS Controls,
as a way to match their summaries of attacks into a standard program for defensive
improvement.

CIS has recently released the Community Defense Model (CDM), which is our most
data-driven approach so far. In its initial version, the CDM looks at the conclusions
from the most recent Verizon DBIR, along with data from the Multi-State Information
Sharing and Analysis Center® (MS-ISAC®), to identify what we believe to be the
five most important types of attacks. We describe those attacks using the MITRE
Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge® (MITRE ATT&CK®)
Framework in order to create attack patterns (or specific combinations of Tactics and
Techniques used in those attacks). This allows us to analyze the value of individual
defensive actions (i.e., Safeguards1) against those attacks. Specifically, it also provides a
consistent and explainable way to look at the security value of a given set of defensive
actions across the attacker’s life cycle, and provide a basis for strategies like defense-
in-depth. The details of this analysis are available on the CIS website. The bottom
line is that we have taken a major step towards identifying the security value of the
CIS Controls, or any subset of them. While these ideas are still evolving, at CIS we
are committed to the idea of security recommendations based on data, presented
transparently. For additional information, reference https://www.cisecurity.org/
controls/v8/.

These activities ensure that the CIS Security Best Practices (which include the CIS
Controls and CIS Benchmarks) are more than a checklist of “good things to do,” or
“things that could help”; instead, they are a prescriptive, prioritized, highly focused
set of actions that have a community support network to make them implementable,
usable, scalable, and in alignment with all industry or government security
requirements.

1 “Safeguards” were known as “Sub-Controls” prior to Version 8 of the CIS Controls.

Overview

Page 2

CIS Controls v8This Version of the CIS Controls

When we begin the work of a new version, we first sit down to establish “design
principles” that will be used to guide the process. These serve as a decision
“touchstone” to remind us of what is really important, and of the goals of the CIS
Controls. While these have been fairly consistent since the earliest versions of the CIS
Controls, we have been refining our thinking over the last couple of versions to focus on
the role that the CIS Controls play in the total picture of enterprise security.

Our design principles include:

•  Offense Informs Defense

 – CIS Controls are selected, dropped, and prioritized based on data, and on

specific knowledge of attacker behavior and how to stop it

•  Focus

 – Help defenders identify the most critical things they need to do to stop the most

important attacks

 – Avoid being tempted to solve every security problem—avoid adding “good

things to do” or “things you could do”

•  Feasible

 – All individual recommendations (Safeguards) must be specific and practical to

implement

•  Measurable

 – All CIS Controls, especially for Implementation Group 1, must be measurable
 – Simplify or remove ambiguous language to avoid inconsistent interpretation
 – Some Safeguards may have a threshold

•  Align

 – Create and demonstrate “peaceful co-existence” with other governance,
regulatory, process management schemes, framework, and structures
 – Cooperate with and point to existing, independent standards and security

recommendations where they exist, e.g., National Institute of Standards and
Technology® (NIST®), Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), Software Assurance Forum
for Excellence in Code (SAFECode), ATT&CK, Open Web Application Security
Project® (OWASP®)

In addition, since Version 7, we have all seen significant changes in technology and the
cybersecurity ecosystem. Movement to cloud-based computing, virtualization, mobility,
outsourcing, Work-from-Home, and changing attacker tactics have been central in
every discussion. Physical devices, fixed boundaries, and discrete islands of security
implementation are less important, and so we reflect that in Version 8, through revised
terminology and grouping of Safeguards. Also, to guide adopters in implementing
Version 8, CIS created a glossary to remove ambiguity of terminology. Some ideas
have been combined or grouped differently to more naturally reflect the evolution of
technology, rather than how enterprise teams or responsibilities might be organized,
and always referring back to our guiding principles.

The text of the CIS Controls document is just one step of a process to design,
implement, measure, report, and manage enterprise security. Taking this entire work
stream into account as we write the CIS Controls, we can support the total enterprise
management process through: making sure that each Safeguard asks for “one thing,”

Overview

Page 3

CIS Controls v8wherever possible, in a way that is clear and requires minimal interpretation; that we
focus on measurable actions, and define the measurement as part of the process; and,
that we simplify the language to avoid duplication.

At CIS, we have always tried to be very conscious of the balance between addressing
current topics and the stability of an overall defensive improvement program. We have
always tried to focus on the foundations of good cyber defense—and, always tried to
keep our eyes on emerging new defensive technology—while avoiding the “shiny new
toys” or complex technology that is out of reach for most enterprises.

The CIS Controls Ecosystem (“It’s not about the list”)

Whether you use the CIS Controls, and/or another way to guide your security
improvement program, you should recognize that “it’s not about the list.” You can get a
credible list of security recommendations from many sources—it is best to think of the
list as a starting point. It is important to look for the ecosystem that grows up around
the list. Where can I get training, complementary information, explanations; how have
others implemented and used these recommendations; is there a marketplace of
vendor tools and services to choose from; how will I measure progress or maturity;
how does this align with the myriad regulatory and compliance frameworks that
apply to me? The true power of the CIS Controls is not about creating the best list, it
is about harnessing the experience of a community of individuals and enterprises to
actually make security improvements through the sharing of ideas, tools, lessons, and
collective action.

To support this, CIS acts as a catalyst and clearinghouse to help us all learn from each
other. Since Version 6, there has been an explosion of complementary information,
products, and services available from CIS, and from the industry-at-large. Please
contact CIS for the following kinds of working aids and other support materials,
https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8/:

•  Mappings from the CIS Controls to a very wide variety for formal Risk Management
Frameworks (like NIST®, Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA),
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), etc.)

•  Use cases of enterprise adoption

•  A list of ongoing references to the CIS Controls in national and international

standards, state and national legislation and regulation, trade and professional
associations, etc.

•

Information tailored for small and medium enterprises

•  Measurement and metrics for the CIS Controls

•  Pointers to vendor white papers and other materials that support the CIS Controls

•  Documentation on alignment with the NIST® Cybersecurity Framework

Overview

Page 4

CIS Controls v8How to Get Started

Historically, the CIS Controls were ordered in sequence to focus an enterprise’s
cybersecurity activities, with a subset of the first six CIS Controls referred to as
“cyber hygiene.” However, this proved to be too simplistic. Enterprises, especially
small ones, could struggle with some of the early Safeguards and never get around
to implementing later CIS Controls (for example, having a backup strategy to help
recover from ransomware). As a result, starting with Version 7.1, we created CIS
Controls Implementation Groups (IGs) as our recommended new guidance to prioritize
implementation.

The CIS Controls IGs are self-assessed categories for enterprises. Each IG identifies a
subset of the CIS Controls that the community has broadly assessed to be applicable
for an enterprise with a similar risk profile and resources to strive to implement. These
IGs represent a horizontal look across the CIS Controls tailored to different types of
enterprises. Specifically, we have defined IG1 as “basic cyber hygiene,” the foundational
set of cyber defense Safeguards that every enterprise should apply to guard against
the most common attacks (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8/). Each IG then
builds upon the previous one: IG2 includes IG1, and IG3 includes all CIS Safeguards in
IG1 and IG2.

Using or Transitioning from Prior Versions of the CIS Controls

We believe that Version 8 of the CIS Controls is the best we have ever produced.
We also appreciate that enterprises who are actively using prior versions of the CIS
Controls as a key part of their defensive strategy might be reluctant to move to Version
8. Our recommendation is that if you are using Version 7 or Version 7.1, you are following
an effective and usable security plan, and over time you should consider moving to
Version 8. If you are using Version 6 (or earlier), our recommendation is that you should
start to plan a transition to Version 8 as soon as practicable.

For prior versions of the CIS Controls, we were able to provide only the simplest tools
to aid in transition from prior versions, basically a spreadsheet-based change log. For
Version 8, we have taken a much more holistic approach and worked with numerous
partners to ensure that the CIS Controls ecosystem is ready to support your transition,
https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8/.

Structure of the CIS Controls

The presentation of each Control in this document includes the following elements:

•  Overview. A brief description of the intent of the Control and its utility as a

defensive action

•  Why is this Control critical? A description of the importance of this Control in

blocking, mitigating, or identifying attacks, and an explanation of how attackers
actively exploit the absence of this Control

•  Procedures and tools. A more technical description of the processes and
technologies that enable implementation and automation of this Control

•  Safeguard descriptions. A table of the specific actions that enterprises should take

to implement the Control

Overview

Page 5

CIS Controls v8Implementation Groups

IG1

An IG1 enterprise is small to medium-sized with limited IT and cybersecurity expertise
to dedicate towards protecting IT assets and personnel. The principal concern of
these enterprises is to keep the business operational, as they have a limited tolerance
for downtime. The sensitivity of the data that they are trying to protect is low and
principally surrounds employee and financial information.

Safeguards selected for IG1 should be implementable with limited cybersecurity
expertise and aimed to thwart general, non-targeted attacks. These Safeguards will also
typically be designed to work in conjunction with small or home office commercial off-
the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software.

IG2 (Includes IG1)

An IG2 enterprise employs individuals responsible for managing and protecting IT
infrastructure. These enterprises support multiple departments with differing risk
profiles based on job function and mission. Small enterprise units may have regulatory
compliance burdens. IG2 enterprises often store and process sensitive client or
enterprise information and can withstand short interruptions of service. A major
concern is loss of public confidence if a breach occurs.

Safeguards selected for IG2 help security teams cope with increased operational
complexity. Some Safeguards will depend on enterprise-grade technology and
specialized expertise to properly install and configure.

IG3 (Includes IG1 and IG2)

An IG3 enterprise employs security experts that specialize in the different facets of
cybersecurity (e.g., risk management, penetration testing, application security). IG3
assets and data contain sensitive information or functions that are subject to regulatory
and compliance oversight. An IG3 enterprise must address availability of services
and the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. Successful attacks can cause
significant harm to the public welfare.

Safeguards selected for IG3 must abate targeted attacks from a sophisticated adversary
and reduce the impact of zero-day attacks.

Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all enterprise
assets (end-user devices, including portable and mobile; network
devices; non-computing/Internet of Things (IoT) devices; and
servers) connected to the infrastructure physically, virtually,
remotely, and those within cloud environments, to accurately
know the totality of assets that need to be monitored and
protected within the enterprise. This will also support identifying
unauthorized and unmanaged assets to remove or remediate.

Why is this Control critical?

Enterprises cannot defend what they do not know they have. Managed control of all
enterprise assets also plays a critical role in security monitoring, incident response,
system backup, and recovery. Enterprises should know what data is critical to them,
and proper asset management will help identify those enterprise assets that hold or
manage this critical data, so that appropriate security controls can be applied.

External attackers are continuously scanning the internet address space of target
enterprises, premise-based or in the cloud, identifying possibly unprotected assets
attached to an enterprise’s network. Attackers can take advantage of new assets that
are installed, yet not securely configured and patched. Internally, unidentified assets
can also have weak security configurations that can make them vulnerable to web- or
email-based malware; and, adversaries can leverage weak security configurations for
traversing the network, once they are inside.

Additional assets that connect to the enterprise’s network (e.g., demonstration systems,
temporary test systems, guest networks) should be identified and/or isolated in order to
prevent adversarial access from affecting the security of enterprise operations.

Large, complex, dynamic enterprises understandably struggle with the challenge of
managing intricate, fast-changing environments. However, attackers have shown the
ability, patience, and willingness to “inventory and control” our enterprise assets at very
large scale in order to support their opportunities.

Another challenge is that portable end-user devices will periodically join a network
and then disappear, making the inventory of currently available assets very dynamic.
Likewise, cloud environments and virtual machines can be difficult to track in asset
inventories when they are shut down or paused.

Another benefit of complete enterprise asset management is supporting incident
response, both when investigating the origination of network traffic from an asset on
the network and when identifying all potentially vulnerable, or impacted, assets of
similar type or location during an incident.

Procedures and tools

This CIS Control requires both technical and procedural actions, united in a process
that accounts for, and manages the inventory of, enterprise assets and all associated
data throughout its life cycle. It also links to business governance through establishing
data/asset owners who are responsible for each component of a business process.
Enterprises can use large-scale, comprehensive enterprise products to maintain IT
asset inventories. Smaller enterprises can leverage security tools already installed on
enterprise assets or used on the network to collect this data. This includes doing a
discovery scan of the network with a vulnerability scanner; reviewing anti-malware
logs, logs from endpoint security portals, network logs from switches, or authentication
logs; and managing the results in a spreadsheet or database.

Maintaining a current and accurate view of enterprise assets is an ongoing and
dynamic process. Even for enterprises, there is rarely a single source of truth, as
enterprise assets are not always provisioned or installed by the IT department. The
reality is that a variety of sources need to be “crowd-sourced” to determine a high-
confidence count of enterprise assets. Enterprises can actively scan on a regular
basis, sending a variety of different packet types to identify assets connected to the
network. In addition to asset sources mentioned above for small enterprises, larger
enterprises can collect data from cloud portals and logs from enterprise platforms such
as: Active Directory (AD), Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),
Virtual Private Network (VPN), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Deep Packet
Inspection (DPI), Mobile Device Management (MDM), and vulnerability scanning
tools. Property inventory databases, purchase order tracking, and local inventory
lists are other sources of data to determine which devices are connected. There are
tools and methods that normalize this data to identify devices that are unique among
these sources.

Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software
(operating systems and applications) on the network so that
only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that
unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented
from installation or execution.

Why is this Control critical?

A complete software inventory is a critical foundation for preventing attacks. Attackers
continuously scan target enterprises looking for vulnerable versions of software
that can be remotely exploited. For example, if a user opens a malicious website or
attachment with a vulnerable browser, an attacker can often install backdoor programs
and bots that give the attacker long-term control of the system. Attackers can also
use this access to move laterally through the network. One of the key defenses
against these attacks is updating and patching software. However, without a complete
inventory of software assets, an enterprise cannot determine if they have vulnerable
software, or if there are potential licensing violations.

Even if a patch is not yet available, a complete software inventory list allows
an enterprise to guard against known attacks until the patch is released. Some
sophisticated attackers use “zero-day exploits,” which take advantage of previously
unknown vulnerabilities that have yet to have a patch released from the software
vendor. Depending on the severity of the exploit, an enterprise can implement
temporary mitigation measures to guard against attacks until the patch is released.

Management of software assets is also important to identify unnecessary security risks.
An enterprise should review its software inventory to identify any enterprise assets
running software that is not needed for business purposes. For example, an enterprise
asset may come installed with default software that creates a potential security risk and
provides no benefit to the enterprise. It is critical to inventory, understand, assess, and
manage all software connected to an enterprise’s infrastructure.

Procedures and tools

Allowlisting can be implemented using a combination of commercial allowlisting
tools, policies, or application execution tools that come with anti-malware suites and
popular operating systems. Commercial software inventory tools are widely available
and used in many enterprises today. The best of these tools provides an inventory
check of hundreds of common software used in enterprises. The tools pull information
about the patch level of each installed program to ensure that it is the latest version
and leverage standardized application names, such as those found in the Common
Platform Enumeration (CPE) specification. One example of a method that can be used
is the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). Additional information on SCAP
can be found here: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.
SP.800-126r3.pdf

Features that implement allowlists are included in many modern endpoint security
suites and even natively implemented in certain versions of major operating systems.
Moreover, commercial solutions are increasingly bundling together anti-malware, anti-
spyware, personal firewall, and host-based IDS and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS),
along with application allow and block listing. In particular, most endpoint security
solutions can look at the name, file system location, and/or cryptographic hash of a
given executable to determine whether the application should be allowed to run on
the protected machine. The most effective of these tools offer custom allowlists based
on executable path, hash, or regular expression matching. Some even include a non-
malicious, yet unapproved, applications function that allows administrators to define
rules for execution of specific software for certain users and at certain times of the day.

Overview

Develop processes and technical controls to identify, classify,
securely handle, retain, and dispose of data.

Why is this Control critical?

Data is no longer only contained within an enterprise’s border; it is in the cloud, on
portable end-user devices where users work from home, and is often shared with
partners or online services that might have it anywhere in the world. In addition
to sensitive data an enterprise holds related to finances, intellectual property, and
customer data, there also might be numerous international regulations for protection
of personal data. Data privacy has become increasingly important, and enterprises are
learning that privacy is about the appropriate use and management of data, not just
encryption. Data must be appropriately managed through its entire life cycle. These
privacy rules can be complicated for multi-national enterprises of any size; however,
there are fundamentals that can apply to all.

Once attackers have penetrated an enterprise’s infrastructure, one of their first tasks is
to find and exfiltrate data. Enterprises might not be aware that sensitive data is leaving
their environment because they are not monitoring data outflows.

While many attacks occur on the network, others involve physical theft of portable
end-user devices, attacks on service providers or other partners holding sensitive data.
Other sensitive enterprise assets may also include non-computing devices that provide
management and control of physical systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems.

The enterprise’s loss of control over protected or sensitive data is a serious and often
reportable business impact. While some data is compromised or lost as a result of theft
or espionage, the vast majority are a result of poorly understood data management
rules, and user error. The adoption of data encryption, both in transit and at rest,
can provide mitigation against data compromise, and, even more important, it is a
regulatory requirement for most controlled data.

Control 03: Data Protection

Page 15

CIS Controls v8
Procedures and tools

It is important for an enterprise to develop a data management process that includes
a data management framework, data classification guidelines, and requirements
for protection, handling, retention, and disposal of data. There should also be a data
breach process that plugs into the incident response plan, and the compliance and
communication plans. To derive data sensitivity levels, enterprises need to catalog
their key types of data and the overall criticality (impact to its loss or corruption) to the
enterprise. This analysis would be used to create an overall data classification scheme
for the enterprise. Enterprises may use labels, such as “Sensitive,” “Confidential,” and
“Public,” and classify their data according to those labels.

Once the sensitivity of the data has been defined, a data inventory or mapping
should be developed that identifies software accessing data at various sensitivity
levels and the enterprise assets that house those applications. Ideally, the network
would be separated so that enterprise assets of the same sensitivity level are on the
same network and separated from enterprise assets with different sensitivity levels. If
possible, firewalls need to control access to each segment, and have user access rules
applied to only allow those with a business need to access the data.

Overview

Establish and maintain the secure configuration of enterprise
assets (end-user devices, including portable and mobile; network
devices; non-computing/IoT devices; and servers) and software
(operating systems and applications).

Why is this Control critical?

As delivered from manufacturers and resellers, the default configurations for enterprise
assets and software are normally geared towards ease-of-deployment and ease-of-
use rather than security. Basic controls, open services and ports, default accounts or
passwords, pre-configured Domain Name System (DNS) settings, older (vulnerable)
protocols, and pre-installation of unnecessary software can all be exploitable if left in
their default state. Further, these security configuration updates need to be managed
and maintained over the life cycle of enterprise assets and software. Configuration
updates need to be tracked and approved through configuration management workflow
process to maintain a record that can be reviewed for compliance, leveraged for
incident response, and to support audits. This CIS Control is important to on-premises
devices, as well as remote devices, network devices, and cloud environments.

Service providers play a key role in modern infrastructures, especially for smaller
enterprises. They often are not set up by default in the most secure configuration to
provide flexibility for their customers to apply their own security policies. Therefore,
the presence of default accounts or passwords, excessive access, or unnecessary
services are common in default configurations. These could introduce weaknesses that
are under the responsibility of the enterprise that is using the software, rather than the
service provider. This extends to ongoing management and updates, as some Platform
as a Service (PaaS) only extend to the operating system, so patching and updating
hosted applications are under the responsibility of the enterprise.

Even after a strong initial configuration is developed and applied, it must be continually
managed to avoid degrading security as software is updated or patched, new security
vulnerabilities are reported, and configurations are “tweaked,” to allow the installation of
new software or to support new operational requirements.

Control 04: Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software

Page 18

CIS Controls v8
Procedures and tools

There are many available security baselines for each system. Enterprises should start
with these publicly developed, vetted, and supported security benchmarks, security
guides, or checklists. Some resources include:

 → The CIS Benchmarks™ Program – http://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/

 → The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST®) National Checklist

Program Repository – https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository

Enterprises should augment or adjust these baselines to satisfy enterprise security
policies, and industry and government regulatory requirements. Deviations of standard
configurations and rationale should be documented to facilitate future reviews or audits.

For a larger or more complex enterprise, there will be multiple security baseline
configurations based on security requirements or classification of the data on the
enterprise asset. Here is an example of the steps to build a secure baseline image:

01  Determine the risk classification of the data handled/stored on the enterprise asset

(e.g., high, moderate, low risk).

02  Create a security configuration script that sets system security settings to meet the
requirements to protect the data used on the enterprise asset. Use benchmarks,
such as the ones described earlier in this section.

03  Install the base operating system software.

04  Apply appropriate operating system and security patches.

05  Install appropriate application software packages, tool, and utilities.

06  Apply appropriate updates to software installed in Step 4.

07  Install local customization scripts to this image.

08  Run the security script created in Step 2 to set the appropriate security level.

09  Run a SCAP compliant tool to record/score the system setting of the baseline

image.

10  Perform a security quality assurance test.

11  Save this base image in a secure location.

Commercial and/or free configuration management tools, such as the CIS Configuration
Assessment Tool (CIS-CAT®) https://learn.cisecurity.org/cis-cat-lite, can be
deployed to measure the settings of operating systems and applications of managed
machines to look for deviations from the standard image configurations. Commercial
configuration management tools use some combination of an agent installed on each
managed system, or agentless inspection of systems through remotely logging into
each enterprise asset using administrator credentials. Additionally, a hybrid approach is
sometimes used whereby a remote session is initiated, a temporary or dynamic agent is
deployed on the target system for the scan, and then the agent is removed.

Use processes and tools to assign and manage authorization to
credentials for user accounts, including administrator accounts,
as well as service accounts, to enterprise assets and software.

Why is this Control critical?

It is easier for an external or internal threat actor to gain unauthorized access to
enterprise assets or data through using valid user credentials than through “hacking”
the environment. There are many ways to covertly obtain access to user accounts,
including: weak passwords, accounts still valid after a user leaves the enterprise,
dormant or lingering test accounts, shared accounts that have not been changed in
months or years, service accounts embedded in applications for scripts, a user having
the same password as one they use for an online account that has been compromised
(in a public password dump), social engineering a user to give their password, or using
malware to capture passwords or tokens in memory or over the network.

Administrative, or highly privileged, accounts are a particular target, because they allow
attackers to add other accounts, or make changes to assets that could make them
more vulnerable to other attacks. Service accounts are also sensitive, as they are often
shared among teams, internal and external to the enterprise, and sometimes not known
about, only to be revealed in standard account management audits.

Finally, account logging and monitoring is a critical component of security operations.
While account logging and monitoring are covered in CIS Control 8 (Audit Log
Management), it is important in the development of a comprehensive Identity and
Access Management (IAM) program.

software, as they are the primary entry point into the enterprise. Appropriate password
policies and guidance not to reuse passwords should be developed.

 → For guidance on the creation and use of passwords, reference the CIS Password
Policy Guide – https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-password-
policy-guide/

Accounts must also be tracked; any account that is dormant must be disabled and
eventually removed from the system. There should be periodic audits to ensure all
active accounts are traced back to authorized users of the enterprise asset. Look
for new accounts added since previous review, especially administrator and service
accounts. Close attention should be made to identify and track administrative, or high-
privileged accounts and service accounts.

Users with administrator or other privileged access should have separate accounts for
those higher authority tasks. These accounts would only be used when performing
those tasks or accessing especially sensitive data, to reduce risk in case their normal
user account is compromised. For users with multiple accounts, their base user
account, used day-to-day for non-administrative tasks, should not have any elevated
privileges.

Single Sign-On (SSO) is convenient and secure when an enterprise has many
applications, including cloud applications, which helps reduce the number of
passwords a user must manage. Users are recommended to use password manager
applications to securely store their passwords, and should be instructed not to keep
them in spreadsheets or text files on their computers. MFA is recommended for
remote access.

Users must also be automatically logged out of the system after a period of inactivity,
and be trained to lock their screen when they leave their device to minimize the
possibility of someone else in physical proximity around the user accessing their
system, applications, or data.

Use processes and tools to create, assign, manage, and revoke
access credentials and privileges for user, administrator, and
service accounts for enterprise assets and software.

Why is this Control critical?

Where CIS Control 5 deals specifically with account management, CIS Control 6
focuses on managing what access these accounts have, ensuring users only have
access to the data or enterprise assets appropriate for their role, and ensuring that
there is strong authentication for critical or sensitive enterprise data or functions.
Accounts should only have the minimal authorization needed for the role. Developing
consistent access rights for each role and assigning roles to users is a best practice.
Developing a program for complete provision and de-provisioning access is also
important. Centralizing this function is ideal.

There are some user activities that pose greater risk to an enterprise, either because
they are accessed from untrusted networks, or performing administrator functions
that allow the ability to add, change, or remove other accounts, or make configuration
changes to operating systems or applications to make them less secure. This also
enforces the importance of using MFA and Privileged Access Management (PAM) tools.

Some users have access to enterprise assets or data they do not need for their role; this
might be due to an immature process that gives all users all access, or lingering access
as users change roles within the enterprise over time. Local administrator privileges to
users’ laptops is also an issue, as any malicious code installed or downloaded by the
user can have greater impact on the enterprise asset running as administrator. User,
administrator, and service account access should be based on enterprise role and need.

Control 06: Access Control Management

Page 24

CIS Controls v8

Procedures and tools

There should be a process where privileges are granted and revoked for user accounts.
This ideally is based on enterprise role and need through role-based access. Role-
based access is a technique to define and manage access requirements for each
account based on: need to know, least privilege, privacy requirements, and/or
separation of duties. There are technology tools to help manage this process. However,
there might be more granular or temporary access based on circumstance.

MFA should be universal for all privileged or administrator accounts. There are many
tools that have smartphone applications to perform this function, and are easy to
deploy. Using the number-generator feature is more secure than just sending a
Short Messaging Service (SMS) message with a one-time code, or prompting a
“push” alert for a user to accept. However, neither is recommended for privileged
account MFA. PAM tools are available for privileged account control, and provide a
one-time password that must be checked out for each use. For additional security
in system administration, using “jump-boxes” or out of band terminal connections is
recommended.

Comprehensive account de-provisioning is important. Many enterprises have
repeatable consistent processes for removing access when employees leave the
enterprise. However, that process is not always consistent for contractors, and must be
included in the standard de-provisioning process. Enterprises should also inventory and
track service accounts, as a common error is leaving clear text tokens or passwords in
code, and posting to public cloud-based code repositories.

High-privileged accounts should not be used for day-to-day use, such as web surfing
and email reading. Administrators should have separate accounts that do not have
elevated privileges for daily office use, and should log into administrator accounts only
when performing administrator functions requiring that level of authorization. Security
personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to determine whether
any browsers or email readers are running with high privileges.

Develop a plan to continuously assess and track vulnerabilities
on all enterprise assets within the enterprise’s infrastructure, in
order to remediate, and minimize, the window of opportunity for
attackers. Monitor public and private industry sources for new
threat and vulnerability information.

Why is this Control critical?

Cyber defenders are constantly being challenged from attackers who are looking for
vulnerabilities within their infrastructure to exploit and gain access. Defenders must
have timely threat information available to them about: software updates, patches,
security advisories, threat bulletins, etc., and they should regularly review their
environment to identify these vulnerabilities before the attackers do. Understanding
and managing vulnerabilities is a continuous activity, requiring focus of time, attention,
and resources.

Attackers have access to the same information and can often take advantage of
vulnerabilities more quickly than an enterprise can remediate. While there is a gap in
time from a vulnerability being known to when it is patched, defenders can prioritize
which vulnerabilities are most impactful to the enterprise, or likely to be exploited
first due to ease of use. For example, when researchers or the community report new
vulnerabilities, vendors have to develop and deploy patches, indicators of compromise
(IOCs), and updates. Defenders need to assess the risk of the new vulnerability to the
enterprise, regression-test patches, and install the patch.

There is never perfection in this process. Attackers might be using an exploit to
a vulnerability that is not known within the security community. They might have
developed an exploit to this vulnerability referred to as a “zero-day” exploit. Once
the vulnerability is known in the community, the process mentioned above starts.
Therefore, defenders must keep in mind that an exploit might already exist when the
vulnerability is widely socialized. Sometimes vulnerabilities might be known within
a closed community (e.g., vendor still developing a fix) for weeks, months, or years
before it is disclosed publicly. Defenders have to be aware that there might always
be vulnerabilities they cannot remediate, and therefore need to use other controls
to mitigate.

Control 07: Continuous Vulnerability Management

Page 27

CIS Controls v8

Enterprises that do not assess their infrastructure for vulnerabilities and proactively
address discovered flaws face a significant likelihood of having their enterprise assets
compromised. Defenders face particular challenges in scaling remediation across an
entire enterprise, and prioritizing actions with conflicting priorities, while not impacting
the enterprise’s business or mission.

Procedures and tools

A large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate the security
configuration of enterprise assets. Some enterprises have also found commercial
services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help
standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities across an enterprise, it is
preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that map vulnerabilities to one or more of
the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration and platform classification
schemes and languages: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®), Common
Configuration Enumeration (CCE), Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language
(OVAL®), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS), and/or Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF). These
schemes and languages are components of SCAP.

 → More information on SCAP can be found here – https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/

SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-126r3.pdf

The frequency of scanning activities should increase as the diversity of an enterprise’s
assets increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor. Advanced
vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to authenticate
into enterprise assets and perform more comprehensive assessments. These are called
“authenticated scans.”

In addition to the scanning tools that check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
across the network, various free and commercial tools can evaluate security settings
and configurations of enterprise assets. Such tools can provide fine-grained insight
into unauthorized changes in configuration or the inadvertent introduction of security
weaknesses from administrators.

Effective enterprises link their vulnerability scanners with problem-ticketing systems
that track and report progress on fixing vulnerabilities. This can help highlight
unmitigated critical vulnerabilities to senior management to ensure they are resolved.
Enterprises can also track how long it took to remediate a vulnerability, after identified,
or a patch has been issued. These can support internal or industry compliance
requirements. Some mature enterprises will go over these reports in IT security steering
committee meetings, which bring leaders from IT and the business together to prioritize
remediation efforts based on business impact.

In selecting which vulnerabilities to fix, or patches to apply, an enterprise should
augment NIST’s Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) with data concerning
the likelihood of a threat actor using a vulnerability, or potential impact of an exploit to
the enterprise. Information on the likelihood of exploitation should also be periodically
updated based on the most current threat information. For example, the release of
a new exploit, or new intelligence relating to exploitation of the vulnerability, should
change the priority through which the vulnerability should be considered for patching.
Various commercial systems are available to allow an enterprise to automate and
maintain this process in a scalable manner.

Control 07: Continuous Vulnerability Management

Page 28

CIS Controls v8Safeguards

The most effective vulnerability scanning tools compare the results of the current scan
with previous scans to determine how the vulnerabilities in the environment have
changed over time. Security personnel use these features to conduct vulnerability
trending from month to month.

Finally, there should be a quality assurance process to verify configuration updates, or
that patches are implemented correctly and across all relevant enterprise assets.

Overview

Collect, alert, review, and retain audit logs of events that could
help detect, understand, or recover from an attack.

Why is this Control critical?

Log collection and analysis is critical for an enterprise’s ability to detect malicious
activity quickly. Sometimes audit records are the only evidence of a successful attack.
Attackers know that many enterprises keep audit logs for compliance purposes, but
rarely analyze them. Attackers use this knowledge to hide their location, malicious
software, and activities on victim machines. Due to poor or nonexistent log analysis
processes, attackers sometimes control victim machines for months or years without
anyone in the target enterprise knowing.

There are two types of logs that are generally treated and often configured independently:
system logs and audit logs. System logs typically provide system-level events that show
various system process start/end times, crashes, etc. These are native to systems, and
take less configuration to turn on. Audit logs typically include user-level events—when a
user logged in, accessed a file, etc.—and take more planning and effort to set up.

Logging records are also critical for incident response. After an attack has been
detected, log analysis can help enterprises understand the extent of an attack.
Complete logging records can show, for example, when and how the attack occurred,
what information was accessed, and if data was exfiltrated. Retention of logs is also
critical in case a follow-up investigation is required or if an attack remained undetected
for a long period of time.

Procedures and tools

Most enterprise assets and software offer logging capabilities. Such logging should be
activated, with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote
access systems (Virtual Private Network (VPN), dial-up, etc.) should all be configured
for verbose logging where beneficial. Retention of logging data is also important in the
event an incident investigation is required.

Control 08: Audit Log Management

Page 30

CIS Controls v8
Safeguards

Furthermore, all enterprise assets should be configured to create access control
logs when a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges.
To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an enterprise should periodically scan
through its logs and compare them with the enterprise asset inventory assembled as
part of CIS Control 1, in order to ensure that each managed asset actively connected to
the network is periodically generating logs.

Improve protections and detections of threats from email
and web vectors, as these are opportunities for attackers to
manipulate human behavior through direct engagement.

Why is this Control critical?

Web browsers and email clients are very common points of entry for attackers
because of their direct interaction with users inside an enterprise. Content can be
crafted to entice or spoof users into disclosing credentials, providing sensitive data, or
providing an open channel to allow attackers to gain access, thus increasing risk to the
enterprise. Since email and web are the main means that users interact with external
and untrusted users and environments, these are prime targets for both malicious code
and social engineering. Additionally, as enterprises move to web-based email, or mobile
email access, users no longer use traditional full-featured email clients, which provide
embedded security controls like connection encryption, strong authentication, and
phishing reporting buttons.

Procedures and tools

Web Browser

Cybercriminals can exploit web browsers in multiple ways. If they have access to
exploits of vulnerable browsers, they can craft malicious webpages that can exploit
those vulnerabilities when browsed with an insecure, or unpatched, browser.
Alternatively, they can try to target any number of common web browser third-
party plugins that may allow them to hook into the browser or even directly into
the operating system or application. These plugins, much like any other software
within an environment, need to be reviewed for vulnerabilities, kept up-to-date with
latest patches or versions, and controlled. Many come from untrusted sources, and
some are even written to be malicious. Therefore, it is best to prevent users from
intentionally or unintentionally installing malware that might be hiding in some of
these plugins, extensions, and add-ons. Simple configuration updates to the browser
can make it much harder for malware to get installed through reducing the ability of
installing add-ons/plugins/extensions and preventing specific types of content from
automatically executing.

Control 09: Email and Web Browser Protections

Page 32

CIS Controls v8

Most popular browsers employ a database of phishing and/or malware sites to
protect against the most common threats. A best practice is to enable these content
filters and turn on the pop-up blockers. Pop-ups are not only annoying; they can
also host embedded malware directly or lure users into clicking links using social
engineering tricks. To help enforce blocking of known malicious domains, also consider
subscribing to DNS filtering services to block attempts to access these websites at the
network level.

Email

Email represents one the most interactive ways humans work with enterprise assets;
training and encouraging the right behavior is just as important as the technical
settings. Email is the most common threat vector against enterprises through tactics
such as phishing and Business Email Compromise (BEC).

Using a spam-filtering tool and malware scanning at the email gateway reduces the
number of malicious emails and attachments that come into the enterprise’s network.
Initiating Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
(DMARC) helps reduce spam and phishing activities. Installing an encryption tool
to secure email and communications adds another layer of user and network-based
security. In addition to blocking based on the sender, it is also worthwhile to only allow
certain file types that users need for their jobs. This will require coordination with
different business units to understand what types of files they receive via email to
ensure that there is not an interruption to their processes.

Since phishing email techniques are ever evolving to get past Something Posing
as Mail (SPAM) filter rules, it is important to train users on how to identify phishing,
and to notify IT Security when they see one. There are many platforms that perform
phishing tests against users to help educate them on different examples, and track
their improvement over time. Crowd-sourcing this knowledge into notifying IT Security
teams of phishing helps improve the protections and detections of email-based threats.

Overview

Prevent or control the installation, spread, and execution of
malicious applications, code, or scripts on enterprise assets.

Why is this Control critical?

Malicious software (sometimes categorized as viruses or Trojans) is an integral and
dangerous aspect of internet threats. They can have many purposes, from capturing
credentials, stealing data, identifying other targets within the network, and encrypting
or destroying data. Malware is ever-evolving and adaptive, as modern variants leverage
machine learning techniques.

Malware enters an enterprise through vulnerabilities within the enterprise on end-user
devices, email attachments, webpages, cloud services, mobile devices, and removable
media. Malware often relies on insecure end-user behavior, such as clicking links,
opening attachments, installing software or profiles, or inserting Universal Serial Bus
(USB) flash drives. Modern malware is designed to avoid, deceive, or disable defenses.

Malware defenses must be able to operate in this dynamic environment through
automation, timely and rapid updating, and integration with other processes like
vulnerability management and incident response. They must be deployed at all possible
entry points and enterprise assets to detect, prevent spread, or control the execution of
malicious software or code.

Procedures and tools

Effective malware protection includes traditional endpoint malware prevention and
detection suites. To ensure malware IOCs are up-to-date, enterprises can receive
automated updates from the vendor to enrich other vulnerability or threat data. These
tools are best managed centrally to provide consistency across the infrastructure.

Being able to block or identify malware is only part of this CIS Control; there is also a
focus on centrally collecting the logs to support alerting, identification, and incident
response. As malicious actors continue to develop their methodologies, many are
starting to take a “living-off-the-land” (LotL) approach to minimize the likelihood of
being caught. This approach refers to attacker behavior that uses tools or features that
already exist in the target environment. Enabling logging, as per the Safeguards in
CIS Control 8, will make it significantly easier for the enterprise to follow the events to
understand what happened and why it happened.

Establish and maintain data recovery practices sufficient
to restore in-scope enterprise assets to a pre-incident and
trusted state.

Why is this Control critical?

In the cybersecurity triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)—the
availability of data is, in some cases, more critical than its confidentiality. Enterprises
need many types of data to make business decisions, and when that data is not
available or is untrusted, then it could impact the enterprise. An easy example is
weather information to a transportation enterprise.

When attackers compromise assets, they make changes to configurations, add
accounts, and often add software or scripts. These changes are not always easy
to identify, as attackers might have corrupted or replaced trusted applications with
malicious versions, or the changes might appear to be standard-looking account
names. Configuration changes can include adding or changing registry entries, opening
ports, turning off security services, deleting logs, or other malicious actions that
make a system insecure. These actions do not have to be malicious; human error can
cause each of these as well. Therefore, it is important to have an ability to have recent
backups or mirrors to recover enterprise assets and data back to a known trusted state.

There has been an exponential rise in ransomware over the last few years. It is not a
new threat, though it has become more commercialized and organized as a reliable
method for attackers to make money. If an attacker encrypts an enterprise’s data and
demands ransom for its restoration, having a recent backup to recover to a known,
trusted state can be helpful. However, as ransomware has evolved, it has also become
an extortion technique, where data is exfiltrated before being encrypted, and the
attacker asks for payment to restore the enterprise’s data, as well as to keep it from
being sold or publicized. In this case, restoration would only solve the issue of restoring
systems to a trusted state and continuing operations. Leveraging the guidance within
the CIS Controls will help reduce the risk of ransomware through improved cyber
hygiene, as attackers usually use older or basic exploits on insecure systems.

Procedures and tools

Safeguards

Data recovery procedures should be defined in the data management process
described in CIS Control 3, Data Protection. This should include backup procedures
based on data value, sensitivity, or retention requirements. This will assist in developing
backup frequency and type (full vs. incremental).

Once per quarter (or whenever a new backup process or technology is introduced),
a testing team should evaluate a random sampling of backups and attempt to restore
them on a test bed environment. The restored backups should be verified to ensure
that the operating system, application, and data from the backup are all intact
and functional.

In the event of malware infection, restoration procedures should use a version of the
backup that is believed to predate the original infection.

Establish, implement, and actively manage (track, report, correct)
network devices, in order to prevent attackers from exploiting
vulnerable network services and access points.

Why is this Control critical?

Secure network infrastructure is an essential defense against attacks. This includes
an appropriate security architecture, addressing vulnerabilities that are, often times,
introduced with default settings, monitoring for changes, and reassessment of current
configurations. Network infrastructure includes devices such as physical and virtualized
gateways, firewalls, wireless access points, routers, and switches.

Default configurations for network devices are geared for ease-of-deployment and
ease-of-use—not security. Potential default vulnerabilities include open services and
ports, default accounts and passwords (including service accounts), support for older
vulnerable protocols, and pre-installation of unneeded software. Attackers search for
vulnerable default settings, gaps or inconsistencies in firewall rule sets, routers, and
switches and use those holes to penetrate defenses. They exploit flaws in these devices
to gain access to networks, redirect traffic on a network, and intercept data while in
transmission.

Network security is a constantly changing environment that necessitates regular
re-evaluation of architecture diagrams, configurations, access controls, and allowed
traffic flows. Attackers take advantage of network device configurations becoming
less secure over time as users demand exceptions for specific business needs.
Sometimes the exceptions are deployed, but not removed when they are no longer
applicable to the business’s needs. In some cases, the security risk of an exception is
neither properly analyzed nor measured against the associated business need and can
change over time.

Control 12: Network Infrastructure Management

Page 39

CIS Controls v8

Procedures and tools

Safeguards

Enterprises should ensure network infrastructure is fully documented and architecture
diagrams are kept up-to-date. It is important for key infrastructure components
to have vendor support for patches and feature upgrades. Upgrade End-of-Life
(EOL) components before the date they will be out of support or apply mitigating
controls to isolate them. Enterprises need to monitor their infrastructure versions and
configurations for vulnerabilities that would require them to upgrade the network
devices to the latest secure and stable version that does not impact the infrastructure.

An up-to-date network architecture diagram, including security architecture diagrams,
are an important foundation for infrastructure management. Next is having complete
account management for access control, logging, and monitoring. Finally, infrastructure
administration should only be performed over secure protocols, with strong
authentication (MFA for PAM), and from dedicated administrative devices or out-of-
band networks.

Commercial tools can be helpful to evaluate the rule sets of network filtering devices to
determine whether they are consistent or in conflict. This provides an automated sanity
check of network filters. These tools search for errors in rule sets or Access Controls
Lists (ACLs) that may allow unintended services through the network device. Such
tools should be run each time significant changes are made to firewall rule sets, router
ACLs, or other filtering technologies.

Operate processes and tooling to establish and maintain
comprehensive network monitoring and defense against
security threats across the enterprise’s network infrastructure
and user base.

Why is this Control critical?

We cannot rely on network defenses to be perfect. Adversaries continue to evolve
and mature, as they share, or sell, information among their community on exploits
and bypasses to security controls. Even if security tools work “as advertised,” it takes
an understanding of the enterprise risk posture to configure, tune, and log them to be
effective. Often, misconfigurations due to human error or lack of knowledge of tool
capabilities give enterprises a false sense of security.

Security tools can only be effective if they are supporting a process of continuous
monitoring that allows staff the ability to be alerted and respond to security incidents
quickly. Enterprises that adopt a purely technology-driven approach will also experience
more false positives, due to their over-reliance on alerts from tools. Identifying and
responding to these threats requires visibility into all threat vectors of the infrastructure
and leveraging humans in the process of detection, analysis, and response. It is critical
for large or heavily targeted enterprises to have a security operations capability to
prevent, detect, and quickly respond to cyber threats before they can impact the
enterprise. This process will generate activity reports and metrics that will help enhance
security policies, and support regulatory compliance for many enterprises.

As we have seen many times in the press, enterprises have been compromised for
weeks, months, or years before discovery. The primary benefit of having comprehensive
situational awareness is to increase the speed of detection and response. This is
critical to respond quickly when malware is discovered, credentials are stolen, or when
sensitive data is compromised to reduce impact to the enterprise.

Through good situational awareness (i.e., security operations), enterprises will identify
and catalog Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of attackers, including their
IOCs that will help the enterprise become more proactive in identifying future threats or
incidents. Recovery can be achieved faster when the response has access to complete
information about the environment and enterprise structure to develop efficient
response strategies.

Control 13: Network Monitoring and Defense

Page 42

CIS Controls v8
Procedures and tools

Most enterprises do not need to stand up a Security Operations Center (SOC) to
gain situational awareness. This starts with first understanding critical business
functions, network and server architectures, data and data flows, vendor service and
business partner connection, and end-user devices and accounts. This informs the
development of a security architecture, technical controls, logging, monitoring, and
response procedures.

At the core of this process is a trained and organized team that implements processes
for incident detection, analysis, and mitigation. These capabilities could be conducted
internally, or through consultants or a managed service provider. Enterprises should
consider network, enterprise asset, user credential, and data access activities.
Technology will play a crucial role to collect and analyze all of the data, and monitor
networks and enterprise assets internally and externally to the enterprise. Enterprises
should include visibility to cloud platforms that might not be in line with on-premises
security technology.

Forwarding all important logs to analytical programs, such as Security Information and
Event Management (SIEM) solutions, can provide value; however, they do not provide
a complete picture. Weekly log reviews are necessary to tune thresholds and identify
abnormal events. Correlation tools can make audit logs more useful for subsequent
manual inspection. These tools are not a replacement for skilled information security
personnel and system administrators. Even with automated log analysis tools, human
expertise and intuition are often required to identify and understand attacks.

As this process matures, enterprises will create, maintain, and evolve a knowledge
base that will help to understand and assess the business risks, developing an internal
threat intelligence capability. Threat intelligence is the collection of TTPs from incidents
and adversaries. To accomplish this, a situational awareness program will define and
evaluate which information sources are relevant to detect, report, and handle attacks.
Most mature enterprises can evolve to threat hunting, where trained staff manually
review system and user logs, data flows, and traffic patterns to find anomalies.

Establish and maintain a security awareness program to
influence behavior among the workforce to be security
conscious and properly skilled to reduce cybersecurity risks to
the enterprise.

Why is this Control critical?

The actions of people play a critical part in the success or failure of an enterprise’s
security program. It is easier for an attacker to entice a user to click a link or open an
email attachment to install malware in order to get into an enterprise, than to find a
network exploit to do it directly.

Users themselves, both intentionally and unintentionally, can cause incidents as a
result of mishandling sensitive data, sending an email with sensitive data to the wrong
recipient, losing a portable end-user device, using weak passwords, or using the same
password they use on public sites.

No security program can effectively address cyber risk without a means to address this
fundamental human vulnerability. Users at every level of the enterprise have different
risks. For example: executives manage more sensitive data; system administrators have
the ability to control access to systems and applications; and users in finance, human
resources, and contracts all have access to different types of sensitive data that can
make them targets.

The training should be updated regularly. This will increase the culture of security and
discourage risky workarounds.

Procedures and tools

An effective security awareness training program should not just be a canned, once-
a-year training video coupled with regular phishing testing. While annual training is
needed, there should also be more frequent, topical messages and notifications about
security. This might include messages about: strong password-use that coincides with
a media report of password dump, the rise of phishing during tax time, or increased
awareness of malicious package delivery emails during the holidays.

Control 14: Security Awareness and Skills Training

Page 45

CIS Controls v8

Training should also consider the enterprise’s different regulatory and threat posture.
Financial firms might have more compliance-related training on data handling and use,
healthcare enterprises on handling healthcare data, and merchants for credit card data.

Social engineering training, such as phishing tests, should also include awareness
of tactics that target different roles. For example, the financial team will receive
BEC attempts posing as executives asking to wire money, or receive emails from
compromised partners or vendors asking to change the bank account information for
their next payment.

Develop a process to evaluate service providers who hold
sensitive data, or are responsible for an enterprise’s critical IT
platforms or processes, to ensure these providers are protecting
those platforms and data appropriately.

Why is this Control critical?

In our modern, connected world, enterprises rely on vendors and partners to help
manage their data or rely on third-party infrastructure for core applications or functions.

There have been numerous examples where third-party breaches have significantly
impacted an enterprise; for example, as early as the late 2000s, payment cards were
compromised after attackers infiltrated smaller third-party vendors in the retail industry.
More recent examples include ransomware attacks that impact an enterprise indirectly,
due to one of their service providers being locked down, causing disruption to business.
Or worse, if directly connected, a ransomware attack could encrypt data on the
main enterprise.

Most data security and privacy regulations require their protection extend to third-party
service providers, such as with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) Business Associate agreements in healthcare, Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council (FFIEC) requirements for the financial industry, and the United
Kingdom (U.K.) Cyber Essentials. Third-party trust is a core Governance Risk and
Compliance (GRC) function, as risks that are not managed within the enterprise are
transferred to entities outside the enterprise.

While reviewing the security of third-parties has been a task performed for decades,
there is not a universal standard for assessing security; and, many service providers
are being audited by their customers multiple times a month, causing impacts to their
own productivity. This is because every enterprise has a different “checklist” or set of
standards to grade the service provider. There are only a few industry standards, such
as in finance, with the Shared Assessments program, or in higher education, with
their Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit (HECVAT). Insurance
companies selling cybersecurity policies also have their own measurements.

Control 15: Service Provider Management

Page 48

CIS Controls v8

While an enterprise might put a lot of scrutiny into large cloud or application hosting
companies because they are hosting their email or critical business applications,
smaller firms are often a greater risk. Often times, a third-party service provider
contracts with additional parties to provide other plugins or services, such as when a
third-party uses a fourth-party platform or product to support the main enterprise.

Procedures and tools

Most enterprises have traditionally used standard checklists, such as ones from ISO
27001 or the CIS Controls. Often, this process is managed through spreadsheets;
however, there are online platforms now that allow central management of this
process. The focus of this CIS Control though is not on the checklist; instead it is on
the fundamentals of the program. Make sure to revisit annually, as relationships and
data may change.

No matter what the enterprise’s size, there should be a policy about reviewing
service providers, an inventory of these vendors, and a risk rating associated with
their potential impact to the business in case of an incident. There should also be
language in the contracts to hold them accountable if there is an incident that impacts
the enterprise.

There are third-party assessment platforms that have an inventory of thousands of
service providers, which attempt to provide a central view of the industry, to help
enterprises make more informed risk decisions. These platforms often have a dynamic
risk score for service providers, based (usually) on passive technical assessments, or
enriched through other firms’ third-party assessments.

When performing reviews, focus on the services or departments of the provider that are
supporting the enterprise. A third-party that has a managed security service contract,
or retainer, and holds cybersecurity insurance, can also help with risk reduction.

It is also important to securely decommission service providers when contracts are
completed or terminated. Decommission activities may include user and service
account deactivation, termination of data flows, and secure disposal of enterprise data
within service provider systems.

Manage the security life cycle of in-house developed, hosted,
or acquired software to prevent, detect, and remediate security
weaknesses before they can impact the enterprise.

Why is this Control critical?

Applications provide a human-friendly interface to allow users to access and manage
data in a way that is aligned to business functions. They also minimize the need for
users to deal directly with complex (and potentially error-prone) system functions, like
logging into a database to insert or modify files. Enterprises use applications to manage
their most sensitive data and control access to system resources. Therefore, an attacker
can use the application itself to compromise the data, instead of an elaborate network
and system hacking sequence that attempts to bypass network security controls and
sensors. This is why protecting user credentials (specifically application credentials)
defined in CIS Control 6 is so important.

Lacking credentials, application flaws are the attack vector of choice. However, today’s
applications are developed, operated, and maintained in a highly complex, diverse,
and dynamic environment. Applications run on multiple platforms: web, mobile, cloud,
etc., with application architectures that are more complex than legacy client-server
or database-web server structures. Development life cycles have become shorter,
transitioning from months or years in long waterfall methodologies, to DevOps cycles
with frequent code updates. Also, applications are rarely created from scratch, and are
often “assembled” from a complex mix of development frameworks, libraries, existing
code, and new code. There are also modern and evolving data protection regulations
dealing with user privacy. These may require compliance to regional or sector-specific
data protection requirements.

These factors make traditional approaches to security, like control (of processes, code
sources, run-time environment, etc.), inspection, and testing, much more challenging.
Also, the risk that an application vulnerability introduces might not be understood,
except in a specific operational setting or context.

Application vulnerabilities can be present for many reasons: insecure design, insecure
infrastructure, coding mistakes, weak authentication, and failure to test for unusual or
unexpected conditions. Attackers can exploit specific vulnerabilities, including buffer
overflows, exposure to Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, cross-site scripting,
cross-site request forgery, and click-jacking of code to gain access to sensitive data,
or take control over vulnerable assets within the infrastructure as a launching point for
further attacks.

Applications and websites can also be used to harvest credentials, data, or attempt to
install malware onto the users who access them.

Finally, it is now more common to acquire Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms,
where software is developed and managed entirely through a third-party. These might
be hosted anywhere in the world. This brings challenges to enterprises that need to
know what risks they are accepting with using these platforms; and, they often do
not have visibility into the development and application security practices of these
platforms. Some of these SaaS platforms allow for customizing of their interfaces and
databases. Enterprises that extend these applications should follow this CIS Control,
similar to if they were doing ground-up customer development.

Procedures and tools

For Version 8, CIS partnered with SAFECode to help develop the procedures
and Safeguards for this updated Application Software Security Control. However,
application software security is a large topic on its own, and so (consistent with the
principles of the overall CIS Controls), we focus here on the most critical Safeguards.
These were derived from a companion paper on application software security that
SAFECode developed (referenced below), which provides a more in-depth treatment of
the topic, and is consistent with SAFECode’s existing body of content.

SAFECode developed a three-tiered approach to help readers identify which
Development Group (DG) they fit in as a maturity scale for development programs.
The three CIS IG levels used within the Safeguards inspired their approach for
the DGs below:

Development Group 1

•  The enterprise largely relies on off-the-shelf or Open Source Software (OSS)

and packages with only the occasional addition of small applications or website
coding. The enterprise is capable of applying basic operational and procedural best
practices and of managing the security of its vendor-supplied software as a result of
following the guidance of the CIS Controls.

Development Group 2

•  The enterprise relies on some custom (in-house or contractor-developed) web

and/or native code applications integrated with third-party components and runs
on-premises or in the cloud. The enterprise has a development staff that applies
software development best practices. The enterprise is attentive to the quality and
maintenance of third-party open source or commercial code on which it depends.

Development Group 3

•  The enterprise makes a major investment in custom software that it requires to run
its business and serve its customers. It may host software on its own infrastructure,
in the cloud, or both, and may integrate a large range of third-party open source and
commercial software components. Software vendors and enterprises that deliver
SaaS should consider Development Group 3 as a minimum set of requirements.

Control 16: Application Software Security

Page 52

CIS Controls v8The first step in developing an application security program is implementing a
vulnerability management process. This process must integrate into the development
life cycle, and should be lightweight to insert into the standard bug-fixing progress. The
process should include root cause analysis to fix underlying flaws so as to reduce future
vulnerabilities, and a severity rating to prioritize remediation efforts.

Developers need to be trained in application security concepts and secure coding
practices. This includes a process to acquire or evaluate third-party software, modules,
and libraries used in the application to ensure they do not introduce security flaws.
The developers should be taught what types of modules they can securely use, where
they can be safely acquired, and which components they can, or should not, develop
themselves (e.g., encryption).

Weaknesses in the infrastructure that supports these applications can introduce
risk. The CIS Controls and the concept of minimizing the attack surface can help
secure networks, systems, and accounts that are used within the application. Specific
guidance can be found in CIS Controls 1-7, 12, and 13.

The ideal application security program is one that introduces security as early into the
software development life cycle as possible. The management of security problems
should be consistent and integrated with standard software flaw/bug management,
as opposed to a separate process that competes for development resources. Larger
or more mature development teams should consider the practice of threat modeling
in the design phase. Design-level vulnerabilities are less common than code-level
vulnerabilities; however, they often are very severe and much harder to fix quickly.
Threat modeling is the process of identifying and addressing application security
design flaws before code is created. Threat modeling requires specific training,
technical, and business knowledge. It is best conducted through internal “security
champions” in each development team, to lead threat modeling practices for that
team’s software. It also provides valuable context to downstream activities, such as root
cause analysis and security testing.

Larger, or commercial, development teams may also consider a bug bounty program
where individuals are paid for finding flaws in their applications. Such a program is
best used to supplement an in-house secure development process and can provide
an efficient mechanism for identifying classes of vulnerabilities that the process needs
to focus on.

Finally, in 2020 NIST® published its Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF),
which brought together what the industry has learned about software security over the
past two decades and created a secure software development framework for planning,
evaluating, and communicating about software security activities. Enterprises acquiring
software or services can use this framework to build their security requirements and
understand whether a software provider’s development process follows best practices.

Establish a program to develop and maintain an incident
response capability (e.g., policies, plans, procedures, defined
roles, training, and communications) to prepare, detect, and
quickly respond to an attack.

Why is this Control critical?

A comprehensive cybersecurity program includes protections, detections, response,
and recovery capabilities. Often, the final two get overlooked in immature enterprises,
or the response technique to compromised systems is just to re-image them to original
state, and move on. The primary goal of incident response is to identify threats on the
enterprise, respond to them before they can spread, and remediate them before they
can cause harm. Without understanding the full scope of an incident, how it happened,
and what can be done to prevent it from happening again, defenders will just be in a
perpetual “whack-a-mole” pattern.

We cannot expect our protections to be effective 100% of the time. When an incident
occurs, if an enterprise does not have a documented plan—even with good people—it is
almost impossible to know the right investigative procedures, reporting, data collection,
management responsibility, legal protocols, and communications strategy that will
allow the enterprise to successfully understand, manage, and recover.

Along with detection, containment, and eradication, communication to stakeholders
is key. If we are to reduce the probability of material impact due to a cyber event, the
enterprise’s leadership must know what potential impact there could be, so that they
can help prioritize remediation or restoration decisions that best support the enterprise.
These business decisions could be based on regulatory compliance, disclosure rules,
service-level agreements with partners or customers, revenue, or mission impacts.

Dwell time from when an attack happens to when it is identified can be days, weeks,
or months. The longer the attacker is in the enterprise’s infrastructure, the more
embedded they become and they will develop more ways to maintain persistent access
for when they are eventually discovered. With the rise of ransomware, which is a stable
moneymaker for attackers, this dwell time is critical, especially with modern tactics of
stealing data before encrypting it for ransom.

Control 17: Incident Response Management

Page 56

CIS Controls v8

Procedures and tools

Even if an enterprise does not have resources to conduct incident response within an
enterprise, it is still critical to have a plan. This would include the sources for protections
and detections, a list of who to call upon for assistance, and communication plans
about how to convey information to leadership, employees, regulators, partners,
and customers.

After defining incident response procedures, the incident response team, or a third-
party, should engage in periodic scenario-based training, working through a series of
attack scenarios fine-tuned to the threats and potential impacts the enterprise faces.
These scenarios help ensure that enterprise leadership and technical team members
understand their role in the incident response process to help prepare them to handle
incidents. It is inevitable that exercise and training scenarios will identify gaps in
plans and processes, and unexpected dependencies, which can then be updated
into the plan.

More mature enterprises should include threat intelligence and/or threat hunting
into their incident response process. This will help the team become more proactive,
identifying key or primary attackers to their enterprise or industry to monitor or search
for their TTPs. This will help focus detections and define response procedures to
identify and remediate more quickly.

The actions in CIS Control 17 provide specific, high-priority steps that can improve
enterprise security, and should be a part of any comprehensive incident and response
plan. In addition, we recommend the following resource dedicated to this topic:

Test the effectiveness and resiliency of enterprise assets through
identifying and exploiting weaknesses in controls (people,
processes, and technology), and simulating the objectives and
actions of an attacker.

Why is this Control critical?

A successful defensive posture requires a comprehensive program of effective policies
and governance, strong technical defenses, combined with appropriate action from
people. However, it is rarely perfect. In a complex environment where technology
is constantly evolving and new attacker tradecraft appears regularly, enterprises
should periodically test their controls to identify gaps and to assess their resiliency.
This test may be from external network, internal network, application, system, or
device perspective. It may include social engineering of users, or physical access
control bypasses.

Often, penetration tests are performed for specific purposes:

•  As a “dramatic” demonstration of an attack, usually to convince decision-makers of

their enterprise’s weaknesses

•  As a means to test the correct operation of enterprise defenses (“verification”)

•  To test that the enterprise has built the right defenses in the first place (“validation”)

Independent penetration testing can provide valuable and objective insights about
the existence of vulnerabilities in enterprise assets and humans, and the efficacy of
defenses and mitigating controls to protect against adverse impacts to the enterprise.
They are part of a comprehensive, ongoing program of security management and
improvement. They can also reveal process weaknesses, such as incomplete or
inconsistent configuration management, or end-user training.

Penetration testing differs from vulnerability testing, described in CIS Control 7.
Vulnerability testing just checks for presence of known, insecure enterprise assets, and
stops there. Penetration testing goes further to exploit those weaknesses to see how far
an attacker could get, and what business process or data might be impacted through
exploitation of that vulnerability. This is an important detail, and often penetration
testing and vulnerability testing are incorrectly used interchangeably. Vulnerability
testing is exclusively automated scanning with sometimes manual validation of false

Control 18: Penetration Testing

Page 59

CIS Controls v8

positives, whereas penetration testing requires more human involvement and analysis,
sometimes supported through the use of custom tools or scripts. However, vulnerability
testing is often a starting point for a penetration test.

Another common term is “Red Team” exercises. These are similar to penetration tests
in that vulnerabilities are exploited; however, the difference is the focus. Red Teams
simulate specific attacker TTPs to evaluate how an enterprise’s environment would
withstand an attack from a specific adversary, or category of adversaries.

Procedures and tools

Penetration testing starts with the reconnaissance of the enterprise and environment,
and scanning to identify the vulnerabilities that can be used as entries into the
enterprise. It is important to make sure all enterprise assets are discovered that are
in-scope, and not just rely on a static list, which might be outdated or incomplete.
Next, vulnerabilities will be identified in these targets. Exploits to these vulnerabilities
are executed to demonstrate specifically how an adversary can either subvert the
enterprise’s security goals (e.g., the protection of specific sensitive data) or achieve
specific adversarial objectives (e.g., the establishment of a covert Command and
Control (C2) infrastructure). The results provide deeper insight, through demonstration,
into the business risks of various vulnerabilities. This can be against physical
access controls, network, system, or application layers, and often includes social
engineering components.

Penetration tests are expensive, complex, and potentially introduce their own risks.
Experienced people from reputable vendors must conduct them. Some risks include
unexpected shutdown of systems that might be unstable, exploits that might delete
or corrupt data or configurations, and the output of a testing report that needs to be
protected itself, because it gives step-by-step instructions on how to break into the
enterprise to target critical assets or data.

Each enterprise should define a clear scope and rules of engagement for penetration
testing. The scope of such projects should include, at a minimum, enterprise assets
with the highest valued information and production processing functionality. Other
lower-value systems may also be tested to see if they can be used as pivot points
to compromise higher-value targets. The rules of engagement for penetration test
analyses should describe, at a minimum, times of day for testing, duration of test(s),
and the overall test approach. Only a few people in the enterprise should know when a
penetration test is performed, and a primary point of contact in the enterprise should
be designated if problems occur. Increasingly popular recently is having penetration
tests conducted through third-party legal counsel to protect the penetration test report
from disclosure.

The Safeguards in this CIS Control provide specific, high-priority steps that can improve
enterprise security, and should be a part of any penetration testing. In addition, we
recommend the use of some of the excellent comprehensive resources dedicated to
this topic to support security test planning, management, and reporting:
